Wild Witch Herbs is a living archive of Old World magic, Balkan folk traditions, and plant lore rooted in the land.  
Here you’ll find the spells, stories, and herbal knowledge carried by witches, healers, and wise women — woven together with modern earth-centered practice.

This project began as a way to preserve endangered European folk magic traditions while giving space to global herbal wisdom, ritual craft, and ancestral pathways.  
Every post is researched, written, and crafted with intention: to honor the plants, the spirits, and the old ways.

If you walk the crooked path, tend wild herbs, or seek the lore hidden in roots and rituals, you’re home.
