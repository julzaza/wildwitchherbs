      Where the green world meets the unseen. A space for folk magic, ancestral remembering, and the old ways of working with land, spirit, and self.

    <p>
      Wild Witch Herbs began as a personal grimoire—a place to collect the plant lore, folk practices, and spirit traditions that have threaded through my life and lineage. Over time, it grew into something more public: a living archive for anyone drawn to the intersection of herbalism, witchcraft, and ancestral wisdom.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here, you'll find practical herb craft alongside deeper explorations of house spirits, lunar rites, Balkan folklore, and the animist traditions that teach us how to live in relationship with the world around us. This isn't about dogma or rigid tradition. It's about <em>remembering</em>—recovering the knowledge that lives in our bones, our gardens, and the stories passed down through generations.

    <h2 style="margin-top:2.5rem;margin-bottom:1rem;font-size:1.5rem;">A Note on Tradition & Ethics</h2>
    
    <p>
      The practices shared here are drawn from folk traditions, academic research, and personal experience. I strive to honor the sources of this knowledge—whether that's a centuries-old herbal manuscript, a conversation with an elder, or the quiet teaching of a plant growing behind my house.
    </p>

    <p>
      This work is inherently syncretic: it weaves together strands from multiple traditions because that is how folk magic has always evolved. At the same time, I believe in giving credit, respecting closed practices, and never claiming authority over traditions that aren't mine to teach.
