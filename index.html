<div style="text-align: center;">

<p>Long before modern medicine, there were witches, midwives, and herbalists.</p>

<p>Here, we revive their legacy through herbal medicine, folk remedies, and plant magic.</p>

<p>Wild Witch Herbs is where old-world herbalism meets modern witchcraft — a place for those who heal with roots, brew with intention, and remember the medicine hidden in weeds.</p>

<p>Come gather what was nearly forgotten — and learn to heal like your ancestors did.</p>
