## The Witching Hour: Why the Full Moon Matters

The full moon has always held power—over tides, over time, and over us. Witches, healers, and herbalists have long honored this lunar peak with ritual, reflection, and plant magic. This is the moment the moon is most alive, glowing fully in her power. And she asks us to do the same.

In cultures across the world, herbs have played a sacred role in these moon rites—from protective smokes to love-drawing teas. Below, we’ll journey through moon rituals and the sacred herbs that carry ancient whispers from forest to fire.

## 1. **Mugwort and the Moon: The Dream Herb of Europe**

In European folk magic, mugwort (*Artemisia vulgaris*) was *the* moon herb. Linked to Artemis, Hecate, and the dark feminine, mugwort opens the gates of dreams, visions, and intuition.

### 🌕 Ritual:
Burn mugwort as incense on a charcoal disc under the full moon. Let the smoke bless your tools or your body. It’s said to awaken psychic vision and protect from harmful spirits while you sleep.

> **Folklore Note:** In medieval Europe, travelers stitched mugwort into their shoes to protect them from exhaustion and evil on their journey—spiritual and otherwise.

## 2. **White Sage and the Full Moon: A Misunderstood Cleanser**

Used in sacred ceremonies by Native American peoples—especially the Lakota, Navajo, and Chumash—white sage (*Salvia apiana*) is burned in *smoke cleansing* rituals to purify space, body, and soul.

### ⚠️ Respectful Use:
Due to overharvesting and cultural appropriation, many witches now grow their own white sage or use local alternatives (like rosemary or juniper).

### 🌕 Ritual:
Light a bundle (or sprinkle dried leaves onto hot coals) and walk counter-clockwise around your space, letting the smoke carry away stagnant energy.

> **Folklore Tip:** Always leave an offering when harvesting any sacred plant—some hair, a whispered thanks, a drop of moonwater.

## 3. **Basil in Indian Full Moon Offerings (Purnima)**

In India, the full moon (*Purnima*) is considered highly auspicious, especially for spiritual purification and blessings.

### 🌿 Sacred Herb: Tulsi (Holy Basil)
Tulsi is believed to be the earthly incarnation of the goddess Lakshmi, bringing love, luck, and protection.

### 🌕 Ritual:
Bathe or sprinkle your altar with tulsi-infused water during the full moon. Meditate or chant near the plant, asking for clarity, harmony, and divine connection.

> **Ayurvedic Folklore:** Tulsi is said to balance all three doshas (Vata, Pitta, Kapha) and lift the heart out of darkness.

## 4. **Wormwood and Balkan Moon Magic**

In the Balkans, wormwood (*Artemisia absinthium*) is a bitter herb of protection and power. It was burned on coals during moonlit divinations or tucked in doorways to ward off spirits.

### 🌕 Ritual:
Place dried wormwood under your pillow on the full moon. Ask for guidance in dreams—or burn a pinch with incense during ancestral prayer.

> **Folklore:** In old Montenegrin and Albanian villages, women brewed wormwood tea and sipped it under the full moon to strengthen their will and keep curses away.

## 5. **Lavender: Moon Herb of Peace Across Cultures**

Lavender (*Lavandula spp.*) spans cultures—from ancient Rome to English cottage witches—as a calming, cleansing herb. It's often used in love spells, sleep potions, and moon bath blends.

### 🌕 Ritual:
Create a full moon bath with lavender, rose, and a handful of salt. Light candles, speak your intentions aloud, and soak until you feel reborn.

> **Folk Tip:** In Southern European villages, lavender was burned in bedrooms during the full moon to prevent nightmares and tempt true love to appear in dreams.

## Bonus Full Moon Ritual: Make a Herbal Moon Sachet

Craft a small pouch with herbs aligned to your intention—dreaming, healing, love, protection. Charge it under the full moon overnight and carry it with you the next day.

**Sample Blend Ideas:**
- For love: rose, lavender, cinnamon
- For clarity: mugwort, rosemary, bay
- For protection: wormwood, sage, juniper

## Harvesting & Storing Ritual Herbs

- Always harvest with respect. Speak to the plant, offer something in return.
- Harvest under the waxing moon for growth magic; under the full moon for maximum potency.
- Dry herbs in a dark, dry place and store them in glass jars or cloth pouches.

## Final Thoughts

The moon’s glow has called to us since before written language. Its pull is primal. Herbs, too, hold ancestral memory in their leaves and stems. Together, they awaken the wild in us.

Whether you burn a sprig of mugwort, stir tulsi into tea, or simply sit beneath the full moon in silence—you are remembering something sacred.

**Blessed Full Moon, Wild Witch.**
