## The Power of the Full Moon in Folk and Witch Traditions

The full moon marks a turning point. Across cultures, it’s a time when veils thin, emotions rise, and stories surface for reckoning or release. The moon governs tides and hearts alike.

For traditional herbalists, midwives, and witches, this is a time to **gather, craft, ask, and answer**.

Herbs have long been tied to the moon—not just in theory, but in practice. Burned, brewed, or tucked under a pillow, they shape rituals in forests, temples, hearths, and gardens.  

Below are **full moon traditions rooted in herbal lore and lived memory**.

## Full Moon Herbal Spell Jar

Create a jar with herbs, salt, water, and intentions. Seal under the full moon. Shake it whenever energy needs stirring.

**Examples:**
- **Clarity:** mugwort, bay, lemon peel  
- **Protection:** wormwood, rosemary, black salt  
- **Love:** lavender, rose, basil, pink quartz

Charge with candlelight and moonlight overnight. Store on your altar or bury at the waning moon to seal the spell.

## Sacred Herbs for Full Moon Rituals

### Mugwort (Artemisia vulgaris): The Seer’s Herb of Europe

Mugwort connects directly to **Artemis, lunar magic, and divination**. Across Europe, it’s the herb of **prophecy, vision, and protection**.

#### Ritual: Mugwort Smoke and Mirror Scrying

Burn dried mugwort on charcoal. Let the smoke fill your ritual space. Place a bowl of water in moonlight, gaze, and watch for **images or emotional insight**. Mugwort thins the veil for intuitive sight.

**Folklore:** In France and Germany, walking barefoot through mugwort fields on a summer full moon strengthened courage and vision. Mugwort was also sewn into dream pillows to protect and guide dreams.

### Tulsi (Ocimum sanctum): India’s Sacred Queen of Herbs

Tulsi is revered in Indian households. Its leaves are **offered, blessed, and carried in ceremonies**.

#### Ritual: Tulsi Water and Moon Chant

Place fresh tulsi leaves in water before sunset. Leave near moonlight, light a candle, and chant a prayer for peace. Drink the water the next morning.

**Folklore:** Harvesting tulsi required asking permission; full moons were ideal for offerings to cleanse the home.

---

### Wormwood (Artemisia absinthium): The Banisher in the Balkans

Wormwood clears interference—illness, spirits, and grief.

#### Ritual: Wormwood Protection Bundle

Bundle dried wormwood and hang over your door on the full moon. Speak: “Nothing crosses but what is true. Nothing enters but what is mine.” Burn the bundle outside at the cycle’s end.

**Folklore:** In Montenegro, wormwood tea was poured around homes to block spirits; in Albania, packed into graves to protect the living.

### White Sage (Salvia apiana): Purification in Ceremony

White sage roots in **Indigenous American rituals**—for purification, gratitude, and spiritual alignment.

**Folklore:** Full moons were times for storytelling and passage rituals in Californian tribes.

#### Ritual: Ethical Alternatives and Ancestral Cleansing

Use rosemary or juniper if available. Light the bundle, waft smoke, and call on ancestors. Let it guide between worlds.

Before burning, check **[Herbs You Should Never Burn in Ritual (And What to Use Instead)](/never-burn-herbs)** for safer alternatives. 

White sage, for example, has become overharvested as it trends across social media. If you want to practice ethically, choose a substitute herb and reserve white sage for the Indigenous communities that hold it sacred.

### Lavender (Lavandula spp.): Soothing the Heart and Soul

Lavender **heals grief, opens the heart, and releases attachment**.

#### Ritual: Lavender Grief Bath

Steep lavender, rose, and myrrh in hot water. Add to a warm bath. Float a bowl with a white flower and whisper what you release. Pour outside under the moon.

**Folklore:** English widows carried lavender on full moons; Provençal women gifted lavender to "sweeten sorrow."

---

### Yarrow (Achillea millefolium): Boundaries and Sight

Yarrow sets **energetic boundaries and clarity**.

#### Ritual: Yarrow Circle Reading

East African sacred herb for **ancestral connection and cleansing**.
