## The Power of the Full Moon in Folk and Witch Traditions

The full moon has always marked a turning point. Across cultures, it’s been seen as a time when the veils grow thin, emotions rise, and old stories surface for reckoning or release. The moon, round and bright, calls the tides and the heart alike. 

For traditional herbalists, midwives, and witches, this is the time to gather, to craft, to ask, and to answer.

Herbs have long been tied to the moon—not just in theory, but in practice. Whether burned in a circle, brewed into a potion, or tucked under a dreaming head, these plants have shaped rituals in moonlit forests, stone temples, kitchen hearths, and back gardens for generations. 

Below are full moon traditions that go beyond the surface, grounded in herbal lore and lived memory.

## Mugwort (Artemisia vulgaris): The Seer’s Herb of Europe

Mugwort’s name alone links it to moon and magic—named for the goddess Artemis, lunar hunter and protector of women. In folk medicine and witchcraft across Europe, mugwort is the plant of prophecy, spirit flight, and protection.

### Ritual: Mugwort Smoke and Mirror Scrying

On the night of the full moon, burn dried mugwort leaves on a charcoal disc. Let the smoke surround your ritual space. Then fill a dark bowl with water and set it in moonlight. Gaze into the bowl and watch for images, symbols, or sudden emotions. Mugwort thins the veil and sharpens intuitive sight.

**Folklore:** In parts of rural France and Germany, women would walk through fields of mugwort barefoot on the summer full moon to strengthen their courage and "see through lies." It was also sewn into dream pillows to keep spirits away and visions vivid.

## Tulsi (Ocimum sanctum): India’s Sacred Queen of Herbs

Revered in India for thousands of years, Tulsi is more than medicinal—she is divine. Her leaves are used in offerings, her fragrance carried in ceremonies, and her presence invited in every sacred household.

### Ritual: Tulsi Water and Moon Chant

Pick fresh tulsi leaves before sunset and place them in a bowl of spring water. Leave the bowl outside or by a window to absorb the moonlight. Light a candle, close your eyes, and chant a mantra or prayer for peace. Drink the water the next morning to bless the body and steady the mind.

**Folklore:** In traditional households, tulsi was never harvested without asking. Women whispered to the plant before plucking a leaf, and full moon nights were considered particularly auspicious for making tulsi offerings to cleanse the energy of the home.

## Wormwood (Artemisia absinthium): The Banisher in the Balkans

Known for its bitterness and strength, wormwood is a plant of reckoning. In Balkan folk magic, it was burned to drive out illness, spirits, and grief. Unlike mugwort, which invites vision, wormwood clears away interference.

### Ritual: Wormwood Protection Bundle

Bundle dried wormwood with string and place it over the door on the full moon. Let it hang until the next waning moon. As you hang it, speak: “Nothing crosses but what is true. Nothing enters but what is mine.” Burn the bundle outside at the end of the cycle.

**Folklore:** In Montenegro, a wormwood tea was poured around the perimeter of homes on the full moon to stop spirits from walking in. In Northern Albania, wormwood was packed into graves of witches to prevent them from rising and casting spells on the living.

## White Sage (Salvia apiana): Purification in Ceremony

While white sage has become common in modern witchcraft, its true roots are in Indigenous American ceremonies—especially among the Chumash, Cahuilla, and Navajo peoples. It was never meant for casual use, but for sacred acts of purification, gratitude, and spiritual alignment.

### Ritual: Ethical Alternatives and Ancestral Cleansing

If white sage is not local or ethically sourced, use rosemary or juniper—both traditional cleansing plants. On the full moon, light the herb bundle and waft the smoke around your body, calling on your ancestors by name. Let the smoke be a path between your world and theirs.

**Folklore:** Among Indigenous Californian tribes, the full moon was a time for storytelling, prayers, and passage rituals. Sage was used to cleanse those who would speak to the spirits—whether elders, dancers, or medicine women.

## Bay Laurel (Laurus nobilis): Leaves of Vision and Fire

Bay leaves were once worn as crowns by oracles and poets. In ancient Greece, they were chewed, burned, and bathed with to invite prophetic dreams and purge falsehood.

### Ritual: Bay Leaf Oracle Fire

Write a question or worry on a dried bay leaf. Sit under the full moon, light the leaf, and drop it into a fireproof bowl. Watch how it burns—slow, fast, erratic. Let that be your omen. Scatter the ashes in running water the next day.

**Folklore:** The Pythia of Delphi, priestess of Apollo, chewed bay leaves before giving prophecy. In Sicilian folk magic, bay leaves were hidden in the beds of the newly married on the first full moon after the wedding—to ensure both passion and honesty.

## Lavender (Lavandula spp.): Soothing the Heart and Soul

Lavender has been used across Europe and the Mediterranean for calming the body and steadying the mind. But it’s also a powerful lunar herb for healing grief, opening the heart, and releasing attachment.

### Ritual: Lavender Grief Bath

Steep lavender with rose and a pinch of myrrh in boiling water. Add to a warm bath under candlelight. Float a bowl of water nearby with a single white flower. When you’re ready, whisper what you are releasing into the bowl, then pour it outside under the moon.

**Folklore:** In English and Provençal folklore, widows were gifted lavender bundles on the full moon to "sweeten sorrow." Some carried lavender oil on mourning veils to guard against being consumed by sadness.

## Yarrow (Achillea millefolium): Boundaries and Sight

Yarrow is a soldier’s herb, but also a witch’s ally. Used for both healing and divination, it creates energetic boundaries and offers insight into complex emotional questions.

### Ritual: Yarrow Circle Reading

Lay fresh or dried yarrow in a circle on the floor. Sit in the middle under the full moon. Close your eyes and ask what you need to protect, and what you must see clearly. Remain quiet until you feel an answer. Many report sudden clarity or visual flashes.

**Folklore:** In Irish and Scottish traditions, yarrow was gathered on Beltane or full moons and carried by midwives. In the Balkans, it was mixed into love potions or sewn into clothing to protect against emotional betrayal.

## African Blue Basil (Ocimum kilimandscharicum): Moon and Ancestors

Used in East African traditions as both medicine and sacred offering, this basil is burned or steeped in moon rites for connecting with the dead or cleansing the air before a rite.

### Ritual: Ancestor Smoke and Blessing Bowl

Burn dried African blue basil on a clay plate. Beside it, place a bowl of water with your family name whispered into it. Speak your blessings or grief aloud. Let the moon hear it all. In the morning, pour the water at the base of a tree.

**Folklore:** In Swahili coast cultures, basil was planted outside the front door on a full moon to invite only benevolent spirits into the home. It was also used in rituals when asking the dead for guidance before major decisions.

## Full Moon Herbal Spell Jar

Create a jar with herbs, salt, water, and written intentions. Seal it under the full moon. Shake it whenever you need to stir the energy.

**Examples:**
- For clarity: mugwort, bay, lemon peel  
- For protection: wormwood, rosemary, black salt  
- For love: lavender, rose, basil, pink quartz

Charge with candlelight and moonlight overnight. Store on your altar or bury at the waning moon to seal a spell.

## Harvesting and Preparing Ritual Herbs

- Harvest only what you need, and always with permission—spoken or silent.  
- Best times are early morning before the sun rises too high or just before dusk.  
- Hang herbs upside down in bunches, out of direct sun. Store in glass or cloth with labels noting the moon phase.

## Final Words

You don’t need expensive tools or elaborate altars to practice moon magic. A single herb, a bowl of water, a whispered truth in the dark—these are the things that open doors.

The rituals offered here aren’t instructions. They’re invitations. Make them your own. Let the old ways meet the life you’re living now. That’s the true magic.

**May the full moon find you exactly as you are—and remind you that it’s enough.**
