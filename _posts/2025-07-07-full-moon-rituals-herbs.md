## The Power of the Full Moon in Folk and Witch Traditions

The full moon has long been honored as a time of revelation, release, and power. Its pull is not only physical—moving oceans and blood—but deeply spiritual. For witches, cunning folk, and medicine women throughout history, this luminous phase marked a portal: a time to cleanse, to charge, to dream, and to summon.

Across cultures, the full moon is linked with plants—burned, brewed, or buried. These herbs carried memory, myth, and magic. Below, you’ll find traditional full moon rituals with sacred herbs from around the world, each one rooted in real folklore, not just aesthetic.

## Mugwort (Artemisia vulgaris): The Seer’s Herb of Europe

One of the most enduring lunar herbs, mugwort has been used across Europe for dreamwork, spirit contact, and protection.

### Ritual: Mugwort Smoke and Moonlight

Place dried mugwort on a charcoal disc and let the smoke wash over your ritual space. Stand in the moonlight, breathe deeply, and ask for clarity or vision. Mugwort awakens the third eye and is known to stir vivid dreams and ancestral contact.

**Folklore:** In Slavic and Germanic traditions, mugwort was gathered on Midsummer’s Eve and worn as a crown to ward off evil spirits. The plant was burned to banish disease and carried in bundles to guard travelers from madness and misfortune.

## Tulsi (Ocimum sanctum): India’s Holy Moon Herb

In India, Tulsi is more than a plant—it is a living goddess. While not traditionally seen as lunar in the West, Tulsi is ritually honored during full moon festivals like Sharad Purnima and Kartik Purnima.

### Ritual: Tulsi Moon Offering

Offer fresh tulsi leaves in a bowl of water under the full moon. Speak your desires or prayers into the water, asking Lakshmi (goddess of abundance) to bless your home. Drink the water the next morning as sacred medicine.

**Folklore:** Tulsi is believed to purify karma and remove energetic poison. In old village households, the plant was given a clay altar and worshipped like a deity, especially under the full moon.

## Wormwood (Artemisia absinthium): Balkan and Slavic Protection Magic

Wormwood carries a darker, sharper energy than mugwort—used for banishing, protection, and moon rites involving justice or revenge.

### Ritual: Wormwood Dream Pillow

Make a sachet with wormwood, garlic skin, and black thread. Sleep with it under your pillow on the night of the full moon. Speak your questions aloud before sleep. Wormwood will stir deep visions, but also confrontational ones.

**Folklore:** In Montenegro and northern Albania, women placed wormwood in cradles and thresholds to protect infants from the evil eye. During full moons, the herb was burned alongside salt to purify the home from spirits of the dead.

## White Sage (Salvia apiana): The Controversial Cleanser

Though widely commercialized, white sage was—and is—a sacred plant to Indigenous peoples of the Americas. It is used for purification and prayer, often under the guidance of elders during full moon ceremonies.

### Ritual: Alternative Smoke Cleansing

If you are not Indigenous or cannot harvest white sage ethically, use native plants from your region—juniper, pine, rosemary, or lavender all carry protective and cleansing properties.

**Folklore:** Among the Chumash and other California tribes, white sage smoke was believed to carry prayers to the moon and ancestors. It was burned during full moons to cleanse spaces before naming ceremonies and rites of passage.

## Bay Laurel (Laurus nobilis): Prophetic Leaves of the Mediterranean

Bay leaves are more than kitchen seasoning. In ancient Greece, priestesses of Apollo chewed or burned bay leaves to induce trance states.

### Ritual: Bay Leaf Moon Fire

Write a fear or limiting belief on a dried bay leaf. At midnight under the full moon, burn the leaf in a fireproof bowl and whisper, “I release you.” Scatter the ashes into the wind.

**Folklore:** Bay was sacred to the Delphic Oracle and considered a lunar plant due to its role in night prophecy. Romans believed sleeping with bay under the pillow prevented nightmares and called down divine dreams.

## Lavender (Lavandula spp.): The Witch’s Comforter

Lavender crosses cultural lines as a calming, protective plant—used in sleep spells, love magic, and purification baths.

### Ritual: Moon Bath of Blessing

Steep lavender, rose petals, and a pinch of sea salt in boiling water. Strain and pour into a warm bath. Soak by candlelight and visualize the moonlight pouring into your body. Speak affirmations or gratitude aloud.

**Folklore:** In old English village tradition, lavender was sewn into sachets and hidden in the clothing of widows to ease mourning during the full moon. In Southern France, fields were harvested before the full moon to preserve fragrance.

## Yarrow (Achillea millefolium): Warrior’s Herb and Spirit Shield

Yarrow is known in both Celtic and Balkan traditions as a plant of protection, divination, and love.

### Ritual: Yarrow Divination under Moonlight

Lay 13 yarrow stalks in a circle on the ground. Sit in the center under the moon and ask a question aloud. Pay attention to the way the stalks shift in the wind or how your intuition moves you toward one. Yarrow is said to strengthen boundaries between worlds and selves.

**Folklore:** In Irish lore, yarrow was used to summon fairies and spirits of the land. In the Balkans, soldiers carried yarrow leaves for protection from wounds and dark enchantment, especially during full moon battles.

## African Blue Basil (Ocimum kilimandscharicum): Moon and Ancestral Veneration

In parts of East Africa, African basil is used during nighttime ceremonies to connect with ancestral spirits, particularly when the moon is bright.

### Ritual: Basil Smoke and Ancestral Prayer

Burn dried African basil on a clay plate while reciting the names of your ancestors. Offer milk or water to the earth. Let the moon witness your lineage.

**Folklore:** In Swahili coastal cultures, the basil plant was believed to attract benevolent ancestral spirits. Women placed leaves in doorways on full moons to invite blessings.

## Full Moon Herbal Spell Jar

Combine herbs based on your intention and seal them in a small jar under the full moon. Add crystals, salt, soil, or water as needed. Shake it as you speak your spell.

**Sample Combinations:**
- Love: rose, lavender, basil  
- Protection: wormwood, bay, rosemary  
- Vision: mugwort, yarrow, jasmine flowers

Seal with wax or thread and keep it on your altar or carry it for a lunar cycle.

## Harvesting and Preparing Herbs for Full Moon Magic

- Harvest herbs during the waxing moon for growth, and under the full moon for maximum magical potency.  
- Speak to the plant, ask permission, and leave a small offering—water, hair, song, or silence.  
- Dry gently in shade and store in glass or cloth. Label them with date and phase of moon.

## Final Words

These are not trendy rituals. They are old. They come from soil, blood, and memory. The full moon is not just a phase. It is a teacher, a mirror, a moment when the unseen can be touched.

Use herbs not as decoration, but as sacred tools—alive with folklore, spirit, and the deep knowing that the wild world still speaks.

**Blessed Full Moon. May your herbs be potent and your visions clear.**
