## Witchcraft Was Not the Same Everywhere

Borders mattered.  
So did religion, law, and empire.

## Croatia: Formal Trials and Imperial Law

Northern Croatia saw:
- documented witch trials
- torture-based interrogations
- legal procedures influenced by Habsburg law

The **Magda Logomer** case represents the peak of this system.

Once Maria Theresa intervened, formal trials declined sharply.

## Serbia: Folk Magic and Poison Fear

In Serbian regions:
- witchcraft stayed closer to village life
- accusations centered on poisoning and harm
- criminal courts replaced witch trials

The **Baba Anujka** case shows how folk knowledge became legal danger.

---

## Bosnia: Magic Without Mass Trials

Bosnia shows:
- fewer formal witch trials
- stronger survival of folk belief
- charms, healing, and fear embedded in daily life

Magic here was often managed socially, not legally.
