## Wormwood and Lucid Dreaming

In the hidden corners of **European folk magic**, few herbs have walked the boundary between waking and dreaming like **wormwood (Artemisia absinthium)**. Its silver leaves and bitter aroma were said to **whisper to the dreamer**, *wake within your dream, see the unseen*.  

Wormwood has a long history as both **protector and guide**: hung over doorways to repel spirits, burned in hearths to dispel nightmares, or steeped in water or wine to open the doors to other realms. This is **not a gentle plant**—its spirit is fierce, restless, and best approached with intention.

### A Herb of Vision and Caution

The secret of wormwood lies in its **volatile oils**, particularly **thujone**, which gently stimulates the nervous system. The balance is delicate: too much can overwhelm, but in careful doses, it **awakens lucid and symbol-laden dreams**.  

Historical grimoires repeatedly warn: *wormwood must be used with reverence and restraint*. Traditional practitioners only employed it on **new moons, crossroads nights, or during guided rituals**—never as a daily tonic.

## Safe Dream Use

**Important:** Wormwood is **potent and potentially toxic**. For dreamwork:

- Use sparingly—never in alcohol-based infusions.  
- Combine with **gentler herbs** like chamomile or mugwort.  
- Drink only in small doses, 2–3 nights per week.  

A properly prepared tea can **stimulate the liminal space between waking and dreaming**, guiding visions while maintaining clarity.
