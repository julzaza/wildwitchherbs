## Wormwood and Lucid Dreaming

Few herbs straddle the boundary between the seen and unseen like **wormwood (Artemisia absinthium)**. Silvery, bitter, and sharp, it has guided witches and dreamers for centuries, whispering: *wake up inside your dream.*

Historically, wormwood was hung in doorways to repel spirits, burned to dispel nightmares, and steeped in teas or tinctures to open gateways to the Otherworld. Its spirit is **fierce and restless**, meant for practitioners willing to walk the edges of consciousness.

### A Herb of Vision and Caution

The secret power of wormwood lies in its volatile oils—especially **thujone**. This compound can sharpen perception and stir vivid dreams. Overuse risks nausea or agitation, so historical practitioners emphasized **ritual, restraint, and intention**.

---

## Safe Dream Use

**Important:** Avoid high doses or alcohol-based extracts. Use **mild teas** and combine with grounding herbs. Only 2–3 nights per week is recommended.

### Lucid Dream Tea — Wormwood & Moon Herbs

**Ingredients:**
- 1 part mugwort (*Artemisia vulgaris*) — the dream herb  
- ½ part wormwood (*Artemisia absinthium*) — the awakener  
- ½ part chamomile — to soothe the nervous system  

**Instructions:**
1. Use **1 teaspoon total** per cup of hot water.  
2. Steep **5–10 minutes**, covered.  
3. Drink **½ cup 30–45 minutes before sleep**.  

Dreams may be vivid, strange, and symbolic. Keep a **dream journal** for reflection.

### The Wanderer’s Infusion (Fresh Wormwood)

**Ingredients:**
- Small fresh sprig wormwood (½–1 tsp chopped leaves/flowers)  
- 1 cup boiling water  

**Instructions:**
1. Steep **≤10 minutes**.  
2. Drink **½ cup before bed**.  
3. Optional: Add honey or mint to soften bitterness.  

Use sparingly, treating it as a **rare ritual herb**, not a nightly tonic.

---

## Folklore and Dream Lore

- **Balkans:** Burned on Saint John’s Eve to protect from spirits; sprig beneath pillow invites visions.  
- **France & Britain:** Carried in shoes for travel protection and stamina.  
- **Dreamwork:** Said to draw the sleeper’s soul along the “silver thread” between worlds.

Wormwood remains a loyal ally for those exploring **threshold consciousness**, but it is not for the timid.

---

## Closing Thoughts

Dream herbs work with ritual, focus, and respect. Pair wormwood with **grounding herbs**, keep a journal, and give your body rest between uses. When honored, wormwood opens the inner temple of sleep, **where witches have walked with eyes open for centuries**.
