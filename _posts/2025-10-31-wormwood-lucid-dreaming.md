## Wormwood and Lucid Dreaming

In old European witchcraft, few herbs walked the borderlands between the seen and unseen quite like **wormwood (Artemisia absinthium)**. Bitter, silvery, and sharp as moonlight on a blade, it was the plant that whispered to the dreamer, *wake up inside your dream*.  

Wormwood was once hung in doorways to ward off spirits, burned in the hearth to drive away nightmares, and steeped in wine or water to open the gates of the Otherworld. It is not a gentle herb. Its spirit is fierce and restless—suited for witches who do not fear walking between worlds.

### A Herb of Vision and Caution

The secret of wormwood lies in its volatile oils—especially **thujone**, a compound that stirs the nervous system and sharpens the edges of perception. Too much, and the mind can fray; just enough, and dreams grow vivid, strange, and strangely clear.  

Old grimoires warned that wormwood “must be taken with reverence and restraint.” The wise would never drink it nightly, but only on special nights—when the moon was new, or when they sought a message from the dead.

## Safe Dream Use

**Important:** Wormwood is potent and potentially toxic in strong or frequent doses. For dreamwork, always use it sparingly, and never as an absinthe-like alcohol infusion. A mild tea is enough to stir the veil.

### Lucid Dream Tea — Wormwood and Moon Herbs

This blend softens wormwood’s harshness while guiding the mind into the liminal space between waking and sleep.

**Ingredients:**
- 1 part mugwort (*Artemisia vulgaris*) – the dream herb of witches  
- ½ part wormwood (*Artemisia absinthium*) – the awakener  
- ½ part chamomile – to calm and soothe the nervous system  

**To prepare:**
1. Use about **1 teaspoon total of the blend** per cup of hot water.  
2. Steep **5–10 minutes**, covered.  
3. Drink **half a cup about 30–45 minutes before sleep**.  
4. Use only **2–3 nights per week**, allowing the body to rest between rituals.

The dreams that follow may be colored by silver and shadow—lucid, strange, and thick with symbols. Keep a notebook by your bed. Wormwood opens the gate, but it is your memory that walks through.

### The Wanderer’s Infusion (Fresh Wormwood)

For those with access to the living plant:

**Ingredients:**
- A **small fresh sprig** of wormwood (½ to 1 teaspoon chopped leaves and flowers)  
- 1 cup boiling water  

**To prepare:**
1. Steep for **no more than 10 minutes**.  
2. Strain and drink **½ cup only** before bed.  

Add a little honey or mint if the bitterness is overwhelming. This tea is sharper, more electric, and should never be used nightly. Treat it as you would a meeting with a powerful spirit—rare, purposeful, and with respect.

## Folklore and Dream Lore

Folk witches of the Balkans burned wormwood on the eve of Saint John’s Day to drive away ill spirits, then slept with a sprig beneath their pillow to invite visions. In parts of France and Britain, travelers carried it in their shoes to prevent fatigue and madness on the road—a charm against both exhaustion and enchantment.

In dreamwork, wormwood was said to draw the sleeper’s soul along the same silver thread that spirits use to travel between worlds. It is not a plant for the timid. But for those who wish to explore the thresholds of consciousness—to dream, and know they dream—wormwood remains a loyal, if dangerous, ally.

---

### Closing Thoughts

Dream herbs do not grant visions to the careless. They respond to ritual, intention, and rhythm. Begin gently. Pair wormwood with grounding herbs, journal your dreams, and take long breaks between uses.  

Used wisely, wormwood becomes what it always was: a key to the inner temple of sleep, where witches have walked for centuries, eyes open in the dark.
