## Why Drink Artemisia Annua Tea?

Traditionally used across Asia, Africa, and Europe, *Artemisia annua* — also known as **sweet wormwood or qinghao** — has been valued for centuries for its effects on the body’s natural balance and resilience.

While we can’t make medical claims, herbalists and traditional practitioners have long used it for:

- Supporting the body’s natural immune response  
- Encouraging healthy digestion, especially during seasonal transitions  
- Creating a clean internal environment where the body can reset  
- Supporting a healthy response to heat and inflammation  

In folk medicine, bitter herbs like Artemisia are **believed to “wake up” the digestive system and help flush out stagnation — physically and energetically**. Such bitter herbs were valued for their ability to “clear heat,” balance the system, and fortify the body’s natural rhythm with the seasons.


In the Balkans, **where we source our tea, women once gathered Artemisia with the moon, drying it slowly** in shaded sheds and attics, away from harsh sunlight. The result is a clean, piercing infusion that feels alive — one cup is enough to remind you: this is no supermarket herb.

## Magical Uses & Rituals

Artemisia isn’t just medicine. She’s a witch’s herb — full of magic, mystery, and protection.

Across cultures, she’s been **burned to cleanse spaces, worn to ward off illness, and brewed in teas to sharpen dreams or deepen trance states**. In Balkan folk traditions, she’s gathered in the waxing moon, hung above doors, or steeped in moonwater for midsummer rituals.

Here are a few ways witches and folk healers use *Artemisia annua*:

- **Dreamwork**: Sip before sleep (in small amounts) or burn as incense to invite vivid dreams and ancestral messages  
- **Cleansing Rituals**: Add the tea to a floor wash or bath to clear unwanted energies  
- **Moon Planting & Harvesting**: Use the tea during waxing moons or new moon planting to align with lunar cycles  
- **Protection**: Place dried Artemisia near doors or windows for spiritual shielding
