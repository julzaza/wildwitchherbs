If there’s one plant that has stood the test of time — from ancient healing halls to witch’s brews — it’s *Artemisia annua*.

This isn’t a gentle floral tea you sip absentmindedly. It’s a bitter, wild brew. A ritual in a cup. A nod to your ancestors and the plant wisdom they carried.

Whether you’re drawn to it for its health-supporting tradition, its role in protective folk magic, or its grounding bitterness, *Artemisia annua* is a tea that asks you to slow down, pay attention, and take your power back — sip by sip.

## Why Drink Artemisia Annua Tea?

Traditionally used across Asia, Africa, and Europe, *Artemisia annua* — also known as sweet wormwood or qinghao — has been valued for centuries for its effects on the body’s natural balance and resilience.

While we can’t make medical claims, herbalists and traditional practitioners have long used it for:

- Supporting the body’s natural immune response  
- Encouraging healthy digestion, especially during seasonal transitions  
- Creating a clean internal environment where the body can reset  
- Supporting a healthy response to heat and inflammation  

In folk medicine, bitter herbs like Artemisia are believed to “wake up” the digestive system and help flush out stagnation — physically and energetically. Such bitter herbs were valued for their ability to “clear heat,” balance the system, and fortify the body’s natural rhythm with the seasons.


In the Balkans, where we source our tea, women once gathered Artemisia with the moon, drying it slowly in shaded sheds and attics, away from harsh sunlight. The result is a clean, piercing infusion that feels alive — one cup is enough to remind you: this is no supermarket herb.

## Magical Uses & Rituals

Artemisia isn’t just medicine. She’s a witch’s herb — full of magic, mystery, and protection.

Across cultures, she’s been burned to cleanse spaces, worn to ward off illness, and brewed in teas to sharpen dreams or deepen trance states. In Balkan folk traditions, she’s gathered in the waxing moon, hung above doors, or steeped in moonwater for midsummer rituals.

Here are a few ways witches and folk healers use *Artemisia annua*:

- **Dreamwork**: Sip before sleep (in small amounts) or burn as incense to invite vivid dreams and ancestral messages  
- **Cleansing Rituals**: Add the tea to a floor wash or bath to clear unwanted energies  
- **Moon Planting & Harvesting**: Use the tea during waxing moons or new moon planting to align with lunar cycles  
- **Protection**: Place dried Artemisia near doors or windows for spiritual shielding

Our *Artemisia annua* is wildcrafted in the sunny southern Balkans — where the climate, mineral-rich soils, and traditional growing rhythms produce plants of striking potency.

- Hand-harvested at peak vitality  
- Dried slowly in the shade to preserve aromatic compounds  
- No fillers. No processing. Just the herb in her raw, intact form  
- 50g per pack — enough for weeks of tea or ritual use

## How to Brew

To prepare:

1. Use 1 teaspoon per cup  
2. Steep 5–10 minutes with a **closed lid** to retain volatile oils  
3. Strain and sip mindfully — she’s bitter, but that’s the medicine  

Sweeten lightly with honey if desired, but we recommend trying her bare first. Let the taste teach you something.

**⚠️ Caution**: Not for use in pregnancy or while breastfeeding. Bitter herbs are strong allies. Begin slowly and listen to your body.

In the old herbal ways, bitter didn’t mean bad — it meant powerful.

*Artemisia annua*, sometimes called sweet wormwood or qinghao, has long been prized for its sharp taste and sharper intelligence. This isn’t your gentle garden herb. It’s a sun-thirsty, silver-leaved survivor — a plant that thrives where others wilt, brimming with volatile oils and ancient strength.

It’s no coincidence that generations across Asia, Africa, and the Balkans have turned to it in times of hardship. This is a plant of resilience. And its tea? Bold, earthy, unmistakable — with a taste that says *you’ve just sipped something real*.

## Why Drink Artemisia Tea?

Drinking *Artemisia annua* is not about soft comfort. It’s a practice, a ritual, a return to something wilder. The bitterness acts like a reset — awakening the senses, stirring the blood, demanding your attention. In folk traditions, such bitter herbs were valued for their ability to “clear heat,” balance the system, and fortify the body’s natural rhythm with the seasons.

In the Balkans, where we harvest our tea, women once gathered Artemisia with the moon, drying it slowly in shaded kitchens, away from harsh sunlight. The result is a clean, piercing infusion that feels alive — one cup is enough to remind you: this is no supermarket herb.

## What Makes Ours Different

Not all Artemisia is equal. Much of what you’ll find on the market is industrial-grown, dried too fast, or diluted with other herbs. Our tea comes from wildcrafted, sun-fed plants — hand-harvested in the south Balkans and slow-dried in mountain air. Nothing added. Nothing altered. Just the pure herb in her strongest form.

The tea is pungent, grassy, and slightly metallic, with a lingering finish that stays with you — not unlike the clarity it offers.

## A Ritual of the Old Ways

To brew it, take a pinch — about a teaspoon — and steep in hot water (never boiling) for 5 to 10 minutes with a covered lid. Inhale the aroma. Taste the edge. If you’re used to herbal teas that are more floral or sweet, prepare to be surprised. This is an herb with an opinion.

Some drink it as a seasonal tonic. Others use it in dreamwork, cleansing rituals, or to simply remember what wild medicine feels like.

## Drink it With Intention

We won’t make bold medical claims. We’ll just say this: there’s a reason *Artemisia annua* has endured for centuries. A reason herbalists, witches, monks, and midwives carried it across continents and down bloodlines. It’s not an herb you forget once you’ve met it.

And if you’re ready to meet it — we keep a small batch of our tea [available here in the shop](/shop/), while the harvest lasts.
