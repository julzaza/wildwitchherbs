# Solstice Spirits and the Wild Hunt: A Witch’s Guide to Surviving the Longest Night

Every culture in Old Europe agreed on one unsettling truth:  
**the longest night of the year belongs to the dead and the gods who ride with them.**

The winter solstice is not just a turning of the sun.  
It is a night when the air thins, the deer freeze mid-step, and an ancient procession shakes the sky—  
**the Wild Hunt**,  
the storm of spirits, ancestors, lost souls, gods, witches, wolves, and winds.

It is the night when every witch stayed awake  
and every door was barred  
not against thieves  
but against immortals.

This is your guide to that night.

## The Wild Hunt Across Europe: Who Rides the Solstice Winds

The Hunt appears everywhere—  
the Norse had Odin and his furious host,  
the Germans spoke of Frau Holle or Perchta leading it,  
the Slavs of Veles’s shadowed retinue.

Wherever it rode, the teachings were the same:

*Stay inside.*  
*Do not whistle.*  
*Do not look at the sky.*  
*Do not call the names of spirits you are not prepared to meet.*

For witches, this was not a warning—  
it was an invitation to pay attention.

## Why the Hunt Rides on the Solstice

The winter solstice is a doorway.  
The sun stands still.  
Time thins.  
The dead are restless.  
The living dream strangely.

In Old Europe, the Hunt was not simply dangerous—  
it was **necessary**.

Its passing cleansed the land.  
It swept away the old year’s rotting spirit.  
It chased out disease, misfortune, bad luck, witch-craft of the harmful kind.

A home the Hunt passed over was “reset.”

A witch who knew how to greet it properly  
could reclaim authority over her land for the entire year.

## Protection Magic for the Longest Night

### 1. **Juniper Smoke**
Highland witches burned juniper to keep away wandering spirits.  
The smoke was said to “sting the ghosts” and make them scatter.

Burn juniper on the threshold and sweep the smoke outward, not inward.

### 2. **Iron at the Doors**
Nails. Horse shoes.  
Anything forged in fire and blood (iron was smelted with slaughter nearby).  
Iron shuts out fae, spirits of the dead, and storm riders.

### 3. **The Solstice Knot**
A charm of red wool, tied nine times at sundown.  
Each knot was a ward.  
The charm was hung above the bed for the Twelve Nights.

### 4. **Blessed Salt at the Corners**
Salt was kept for the Hunt.  
Sprinkled at the four corners of a home before midnight,  
it was believed to anchor the living firmly in their rightful world.

## Herbs of the Solstice Hunt

### **Mugwort**  
Worn for vision.  
Burned for protection.  
Believed to help the witch stay “awake” even when dreaming.

### **Yew**  
The grave-tree.  
A branch hung near the door kept the dead from wandering inside.

### **Blackthorn**  
A thorn placed in the window kept Perchta’s blade from entering the home.

### **Wormwood**  
The plant of the restless dead.  
Witches burned it to show the Hunt they were not afraid—  
and to avoid being carried away.

## What Happens If You See the Hunt

Folklore is clear:  
you do not run.  
You do not scream.  
You bow your head.  
You stand still as a post.  
If addressed, answer simply:

**“I belong to the living.”**

And never accept a gift.

## A Solstice Rite of Protection

Perform at midnight, or when the sky “hums,” as the elders said.

1. Stand at your doorway.  
2. Hold a sprig of juniper and a bowl of salt.  
3. Speak:

   **“Winds of the Hunt, pass over.  
   Riders of storm, ride on.  
   My threshold is guarded.  
   My fire is my own.”**

4. Scatter salt behind you, never in front of the door.  
5. Hang the juniper above the lintel until Twelfth Night.

## Why Witches Still Honor the Wild Hunt

Because the Hunt is not a story.  
It is a cycle.  
A cleansing.  
A reminder of our smallness and our alignment with forces older than scripture or civilization.

On the solstice, the sun dies.  
The Hunt rides.  
And the world waits to be reborn.

A witch who understands that rhythm  
walks into the new year with power,  
clarity,  
and protection.
