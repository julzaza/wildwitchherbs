Balkan love magic was **not about romance**.

It was about:
- Securing marriage  
- Preventing abandonment  
- Breaking rivals  
- Binding desire when survival depended on it  

And everyone feared it.

## Where It Was Practiced

Documented traditions exist in:
- **Eastern Serbia (Timok, Negotin)**  
- **Wallachia and Oltenia (Romania)**  
- **Western Bulgaria**  
- **Macedonian border regions**

Many overlap with practices described in  
**[Vlach Magic of Negotin](/vlach-magic-negotin/)**.

---

## Bodily Magic (The Taboo Core)

Love magic often involved the body.

Documented practices include:
- Menstrual blood in wine or rakija  
- Sweat from underarms added to bread  
- Hair cooked into food  
- Soil taken from footprints  

These were not symbolic.

They were **contagion magic** — binding through physical trace.

---

## Graveyard Love Work

Some of the most feared practices involved the dead.

Women would:
- Take soil from graves of the recently buried  
- Sleep with love charms under pillows  
- Speak names at crossroads at midnight  

This echoes death-bound practices explored in  
**[Why Balkan Witches Survived](/balkan-witches/)**.

## Herbs Used (No Romance Here)

Common plants:
- **Wormwood** — obsession, bitterness, domination  
- **Lovage** (*Levisticum officinale*) — control, attraction  
- **Basil** — marriage fate  
- **Garlic** — protection *from* love magic  

This contrasts with gentler herb uses in  
**[Herbs You Should Never Burn in Ritual](/never-burn-herbs/)**.

---

## Why It Was Feared

Love magic was believed to cause:
- Madness  
- Physical wasting  
- Sexual fixation  
- Death by longing  

Men accused women.  
Women accused rivals.  
Communities whispered.

This was **not empowerment** — it was desperation.

## What This Teaches Modern Practitioners

If you remove danger from love magic, you remove truth.

Balkan traditions remind us:
- Desire binds  
- Binding costs  
- Magic without consent corrodes
