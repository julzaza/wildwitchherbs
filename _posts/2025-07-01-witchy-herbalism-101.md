faq:
  - question: "What is witchy herbalism and how do I start?"
    answer: "Witchy herbalism is the practice of working with plants for protection, healing, divination, and ritual magic. Beginners should start with one herb at a time, observe its effects, and use safe applications like teas, incense, charms, or simple rituals while journaling experiences."

  - question: "Which herbs are essential for beginner witches?"
    answer: "Core herbs include Wormwood, Mugwort, Sage, Chamomile, Lavender, Yarrow, Rosemary, Calendula, and Thyme. These herbs have historical uses in protection, dreamwork, cleansing, love, healing, and solar magic."

  - question: "Are these herbs safe to use?"
    answer: "Many herbs are potent or toxic. Use caution, follow historical guidance, and avoid ingesting or experimenting with unfamiliar plants without proper knowledge. Observing their effects through ritual or symbolic use is safest for beginners."

  - question: "Can I grow witchy herbs at home?"
    answer: "Yes. Most herbs can be grown in pots, jars, gardens, or small urban spaces. Some, like Belladonna or Wormwood, require caution or should not be ingested. Starting small and observing growth is recommended."

  - question: "How do I choose which herb to work with first?"
    answer: "Pick one herb that resonates with your magical or practical goals. Learn its smell, touch, historical uses, and folklore before moving to another. Building a relationship with the plant is more important than mastering multiple herbs at once."

  - question: "Are witchy herbs tied to specific regions?"
    answer: "Yes. Many herbs have roots in European, Balkan, and Mediterranean folk traditions. Some, like Mugwort and Sage, appear worldwide, but their magical and medicinal roles can vary by region."

  - question: "Where can I learn more about using herbs in rituals?"
    answer: "Explore linked guides on smoke cleansing, moon water, full moon rituals, and starter herbal kits. Observing traditional practice and recorded ethnobotany helps you safely incorporate herbs into ritual work."

  - question: "Do these herbs really have magical effects?"
    answer: "Folklore and historical accounts describe herbs influencing dreams, protection, healing, and divination. Effects may be subtle or symbolic, but the ritual use, intention, and connection to ancestral practices are key."

Witchy herbalism was never about pretty jars or vague energy.  
It was about **plants that worked**, sometimes violently, sometimes slowly, and often at a cost.

Long before witchcraft was an identity, it was a **necessity**. People turned to herbs because doctors were distant, priests were limited, and survival demanded knowledge that could be passed quietly, hand to hand.

If you want magic, healing, and connection, you start with understanding these herbs.

## Why Witchy Herbalism Was Taken Seriously

**Herbs are tools. Like knives or fire**. They can heal or hurt. They carry specific properties, histories, and uses that go beyond fairy tales. Learning about them means respecting their power—and knowing how to work with them safely and effectively.

In folk traditions herbs were **forces** — capable of healing wounds, ending pregnancies, breaking fevers, calling dreams, or bringing death.

This is why herbalists were respected and feared in equal measure.

To know plants was to know:
- how illness moved through a household  
- how grief settled in the body  
- how spirits were attracted, repelled, or fed  

Herbal magic did not separate medicine from ritual.  
It never had the luxury to.

## The Plants That Refused to Disappear

Certain herbs appear again and again in witch trials, folk remedies, burial customs, and seasonal rites — not because they were symbolic, but because they *did something*.

- **Wormwood (Artemisia)**: This bitter, bold herb isn’t for casual dabblers. Used for protection, banishing, and opening your mind to the unseen, wormwood has a reputation for both healing and harsh truths. It’s often misunderstood but fiercely effective if you respect its strength.  
- **Mugwort**: The go-to for dream work and psychic clarity. Don’t underestimate this wild herb—it’s sharp, it’s potent, and it’s been used for centuries to guard witches and shamans alike.  
- **Sage**: The classic cleanser. Used to clear space and mind. It’s blunt, effective, and absolutely necessary when you want to start fresh.  
- **Chamomile**: Not just a calming tea. It’s subtle magic for peace, calming anxiety, and sometimes coaxing in good luck.  
- **Lavender**: More than a pretty scent, lavender soothes nerves, invites calm, and is a staple for protection and love spells.  
- **Yarrow**: A fierce warrior herb used for healing wounds, protection, and strengthening spells. It’s tough, sharp, and packed with power.  
- **Rosemary**: The herbal watchdog. Protects homes and spirits alike, boosts memory, and sharpens intuition.  
- **Calendula**: Bright and bold, calendula is used for healing, attracting positivity, and enhancing solar (sun) magic.
- **Thyme**: Protected homes, dead bodies, and memories.

##  How to Start Without Getting Overwhelmed

Pick one herb. Learn it. Work with it.
Traditional herbalism was never about mastery.  
It was about **relationship**.

People learned one plant slowly:
- how it smelled when burned  
- how it felt in the hand  
- how the body reacted  
- how dreams shifted  

Mistakes were remembered. Success was repeated.  
Knowledge accumulated quietly.

**This is why folk magic feels fragmented today — it was never meant to be explained all at once.**

So keep a journal. Write what you feel. Be honest. Magic is messy and personal.
