## Myth 1: Balkan Witches Were Devil-Worshippers

This idea comes largely from **Western European demonology**, not Balkan records.

Most Balkan accusations focused on:
- illness
- crop failure
- poisoning
- harmful folk magic

Demonic pacts and sabbaths appear **far less frequently** in surviving court material.

Witches here were feared for *practical harm*, not cosmic rebellion.

## Myth 2: Balkan Witch Hunts Ended Early

In reality, accusations **lasted longer** than in much of Western Europe.

Formal trials declined in the late 1700s, but:
- informal accusations continued
- folk healers remained suspect
- criminal poison trials replaced witch courts

The case of **Baba Anujka** in 1920s Yugoslavia proves this continuity.

## Myth 3: Witches Were Isolated Outsiders

Many accused women were:
- embedded in their villages
- known healers or widows
- socially visible, not marginal hermits

They became “witches” when **trust collapsed**, not because they lived outside society.

### Why These Myths Persist

Because Balkan witchcraft doesn’t fit neat Western narratives.
