Long before Bram Stoker imagined Transylvania, **Balkan villagers already knew how to keep the dead from rising**.  

The heart of those stories beats in **Vlach communities along the Timok and Danube**, where pagan rites lingered beneath a Christian surface.

### Garlic: The Universal Ward
Serbian peasants stuffed **braids of garlic** under pillows, into graves, and even inside the mouths of suspected vampires.  

Modern studies show garlic’s **allicin** is strongly antimicrobial—an uncanny real-world parallel to its mythic ability to “kill the rot of death.”

### Hawthorn Stakes and Wild Rose Barriers
Vlach burial rites sometimes used **hawthorn stakes** through the corpse or planted **wild rose hedges** around cemeteries.  

Both plants bristle with thorns, a literal **protective fence**, and hawthorn contains **heart-strengthening flavonoids**, symbolic of keeping the *heart of the dead* still.

### Wormwood Smoke and Juniper Fire
Before funerals, homes were fumigated with **wormwood and juniper** to drive off the *vampir*.  

Science confirms these herbs release **volatile oils lethal to insects and bacteria**, supporting their reputation as **purifiers of the threshold**.

### The Vlach Link
Ethnographers trace these practices to **pre-Christian Dacian and Thracian rituals**, preserved among the Vlachs, whose language is close to Romanian.  

Travelers in the 18th century—decades before *Dracula*—recorded villagers performing midnight stakeings and **blood-sealing charms** along the Timok River.

### From Balkans to Britain
Reports of Serbian vampire hunts in the 1720s (notably the case of **Arnold Paole**) spread through European newspapers, **feeding the Gothic imagination** that later inspired Stoker.
