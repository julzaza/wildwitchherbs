Stinging nettle (*Urtica dioica*) is an incredibly potent plant ally for moon water magic, especially when you're working with themes of **protection**, **banishing**, **courage**, and **ancestral strength**. 

While not as commonly used in lunar workings as herbs like mugwort or jasmine, nettle’s wild and fiery nature makes it a powerful complement to the moon’s cold, intuitive energy.

## Magical Properties of Stinging Nettle

- **Protection** – Wards off hexes, evil eyes, curses, and unwanted energies.  
- **Banishing** – Burns through spiritual stagnation and harmful attachments, especially emotional ones. 
- **Courage + Vitality** – Acts as magical armor, supporting emotional resilience and assertiveness.  
- **Ancestral Connection** – With deep folk roots in Europe, nettle can help connect with ancestral wisdom, particularly through maternal lines or warrior spirits.  
- **Survival and Boundaries** – Teaches self-reliance, discernment, and strength.

## When to Use Nettle in Moon Water

- **Dark Moon** – For severing ties, cutting cords, clearing toxic influences, or spiritual detox.  Dark Moon is when the Moon is not visible from Earth, specifically the last days of the waning crescent before the new moon.
- **Full Moon** – To amplify personal power, reinforce boundaries, and reclaim energy drained by others.  Now that's what the doctor ordered!
- **New Moon** – To root into courage and resilience at the start of a new cycle, especially after burnout or trauma.
