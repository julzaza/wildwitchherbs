# 7 Witchy Herbs from Around the World  
**And the Stories They Tell**

Some herbs weren’t grown for tea. They were grown to speak, to shield, to hex, to heal. In every corner of the world, witches, midwives, shamans, and root-workers knew which leaves to burn when the air grew strange, which roots to bury when someone died, which seeds to plant under silence.

These seven herbs didn’t come from Pinterest. They come from bloodlines. From field chants. From whispered names passed down behind closed doors.

---

## 1. **Guinea Hen Weed (*Petiveria alliacea*)**  
**Region:** Caribbean, Central & South America  
**Uses:** Spirit protection, banishing, fever remedy  
**Story:** Known as *Anamu* in the Caribbean and Central America, this plant is used in Afro-Caribbean traditions like Vodou and Santería. It’s burned to ward off malevolent spirits, brewed to break hexes, and worn in mojo bags. The smell is pungent — sulfurous, like garlic and something deeper — and that’s exactly why it's feared and respected.

## 2. **Lovage (*Levisticum officinale*)**  
**Region:** Eastern & Central Europe  
**Uses:** Love spells, protection, purification  
**Story:** In Slavic countries, lovage was added to baths to draw love and cleanse the soul before feast days. Girls washed their hair with it on Ivan Kupala night — the midsummer solstice — while jumping through fire and looking for the mythical fern flower. In Romanian folklore, it's a wedding herb and a grave herb both.

## 3. **African Dream Root (*Silene capensis*)**  
**Region:** South Africa  
**Uses:** Dreamwork, ancestral communication  
**Story:** Used by the Xhosa people to induce vivid dreams and communicate with ancestors. The root is powdered, mixed with water, and taken at night — not recreationally, but ritually, often after abstinence or fasting. Dreams are seen as a meeting ground, and this plant opens the gate.

## 4. **Blue Vervain (*Verbena hastata*)**  
**Region:** North America  
**Uses:** Protection, divination, healing anxiety  
**Story:** The Cherokee used it as a calming and spiritual herb, especially in rites of transition. In hoodoo, it’s considered sacred and placed in sachets to protect from slander or betrayal. European colonists also saw it as a holy plant — even the Druids are said to have used its cousin for prophecy and offerings.

## 5. **Holy Basil (*Ocimum sanctum*, also *Tulsi*)**  
**Region:** India  
**Uses:** Spiritual protection, purification, devotion  
**Story:** Nearly every traditional Hindu home keeps a tulsi plant in a central spot, often in a hand-built altar. It’s watered and worshipped daily, especially by women, and is believed to embody the goddess Lakshmi. The smoke of dried tulsi is said to cleanse not only rooms but karma.

---

## 6. **Boldo (*Peumus boldus*)**  
**Region:** Chile  
**Uses:** Liver healing, energetic cleansing, spiritual awakening  
**Story:** In Chilean folk healing and *curanderismo*, boldo is brewed into tea to cleanse the liver — but it’s also used spiritually. The leaves are burned like incense to dispel heavy energy. Some Mapuche healers use it to clear illness that has “settled in the shadow.”

---

## 7. **Yarrow (*Achillea millefolium*)**  
**Region:** Europe, North America, Asia  
**Uses:** Protection, battle wounds, divination  
**Story:** Named after Achilles, yarrow has followed soldiers and witches alike. In Chinese divination, dried yarrow stalks were used in *I Ching*. In Slavic lore, brides carried it to the wedding bed for protection. In battle, it was packed into wounds to stop blood — and sometimes offered to the dead to help them cross over.

## Final Words

These plants weren’t just grown — they were *worked with*. You don’t need to follow every ritual exactly, but you do need to respect where the magic came from.

If you’re going to call yourself a witch, learn the names that came before yours. Learn the herbs that whisper in your blood. And don’t just grow them — ask what they want from you.
