# 🌿 The Witch’s Herbal Starter Kit  
**10 Plants That Have Protected, Poisoned, and Empowered Witches for Centuries**

**Not every witch wears black. Some wear wormwood and carry rue.**  
This is not a list of “gentle herbal allies.” These are the real ones — **folk medicine plants**, **poisonous protectors**, and **ritual tools** used in spells, curses, midwifery, and burial rites.  

Whether you're new to the path or already deep in your craft, these ten herbs are your starting point. They bite. They heal. They teach.

## 🌕 1. **Mugwort** (*Artemisia vulgaris*)  
**The dreamwalker. Moon-tied. Shadow herb.**

Used in every corner of Europe, mugwort is for those who want to see behind the veil. Burn it before sleep for lucid dreams. Tuck it in your pillow to call back the dead.  

In Slavic Midsummer rituals, mugwort was braided and worn to protect against madness and wandering spirits. It’s been smoked, steeped, burned, and carried as a charm.  

> Mugwort doesn’t ask for permission. She opens doors.

---

## 🔥 2. **Wormwood** (*Artemisia absinthium*)  
**Banishing. Bitter. Bold.**

Cleansing, yes — but not gentle. Wormwood was used in spells of expulsion and protection. In Balkan funerals, it was burned to keep spirits from returning. In Western grimoires, it’s listed in hexes and spirit evictions.

> Think of wormwood as the herb of goodbye. Sharp, final, and unrepentant.

---

## ☠️ 3. **Artemisia annua** (*Sweet Wormwood*)  
**The purifier. Ghost chaser. Fever breaker.**

Less known in Western witchcraft, but powerful. In Traditional Chinese Medicine, *Artemisia annua* (Qing Hao) has been used for over 2,000 years — especially for fevers and “heat demons.” Today, it’s one of the few plants that helped break the grip of malaria.  

In modern folk use, it’s gaining traction as a **ritual cleansing herb**, burned to clear stagnant or sick rooms. Some call it “the new sage,” though it has a darker, wilder smell.  

> If you work with disease, death, or spirits, Artemisia annua belongs on your altar.

---

## 🩸 4. **Nettle** (*Urtica dioica*)  
**The stinger. The strengthener. The blood builder.**

Used for pain, purification, and protection. Nettle builds iron, wakes up tired blood, and stings the lazy. In Scottish charms, nettle baths were given to children to drive out “the fae.” In Eastern Europe, it was boiled on Beltane to protect from spirits.

> Nettle teaches boundaries. She doesn’t ask — she tells.

---

## 🛡️ 5. **Yarrow** (*Achillea millefolium*)  
**Healer of wounds. Keeper of thresholds. Love-dreamer.**

A warrior’s herb and a seer’s herb. Achilles used it on the battlefield. Witches used it in divination and love magic. Still hung today in rural homes to ward off lightning and gossip.

> Carry yarrow if you want truth. Burn it if you want vision. Drink it if you want dreams.

---

## 🐍 6. **Rue** (*Ruta graveolens*)  
**Witch’s protection. The bitter grace. The curse-breaker.**

Worn on the body. Tied in red thread. Rue has protected Balkan, Italian, and Greek homes for centuries. Also used to drive away madness, obsession, and curses.

> Rue doesn’t ask what your problem is. She cuts it off at the root.

---

## ✝️ 7. **Vervain** (*Verbena officinalis*)  
**The crossroad herb. The sacred blood herb. The spell activator.**

Collected under moonlight without iron. Used in rituals by Druids, witches, and Christian mystics alike. Said to stop bleeding, open the third eye, and summon helpful spirits.

> Vervain walks the line between sacred and profane.

---

## 🌬️ 8. **Dandelion** (*Taraxacum officinale*)  
**The sun weed. The ancestor flower. The soul guide.**

Every part is medicine. Dandelion roots detox. The yellow heads feed bees and dreams. The seeds — well, you already know: blow and wish. But it’s not a child’s game. It’s divination.

> The weed you step on today might be the ghost who answers your call tomorrow.

---

## ⚰️ 9. **Belladonna** (*Atropa belladonna*)  
**Poison. Vision. Seduction. Death.**

Not for consumption. Used with extreme care. Belladonna was an ingredient in witch’s flying ointments, where it was absorbed through the skin to bring visions or spirit travel.

> She’s the dark mirror in the herb world. You don’t work with Belladonna unless she chooses you.

---

## 🔥 10. **Thyme** (*Thymus vulgaris*)  
**The smoke of courage. The herb of the dead. The warmth of memory.**

Thyme was burned in Roman temples and buried with the dead in ancient Egypt. In Slavic homes, it was brewed in tea to cleanse the spirit or boiled and poured into floor washes to expel darkness.

> Thyme clears grief. And when you’ve lost your way — it brings you back.

## 🌒 Closing the Circle

These ten herbs have been burned, buried, boiled, and feared.  
They’re not decorations. They’re **tools of power** — and **witnesses** to old magic.  

Start with the ones that call to you. Grow them if you can. Burn their leaves. Drink their roots. Speak their names.

And always — always — show respect.
