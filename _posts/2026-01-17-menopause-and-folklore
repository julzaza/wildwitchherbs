# Menopause: Folklore, Power & the Modern Medical Myth

Menopause did not begin as a medical problem.

It became one.

Before endocrinology, pharmaceuticals, and productivity economics, menopause marked a **reclassification of a woman’s place in the world**. Folklore did not ask how to *fix* her — it asked what she was now permitted to do.

And the answer was often: **more than before**.

This post examines menopause through **documented folklore, historical roles, and witchcraft traditions**, and contrasts them with the modern medical narrative — without nostalgia, spiritual bypassing, or invented myths.

## Menopause Before Medicine Had a Name for It

In pre-industrial societies, women’s value was not measured solely by reproductive capacity.

Once menstruation ceased, a woman was no longer:
- biologically vulnerable to pregnancy  
- ritually “open” through blood loss  
- socially confined to childbearing roles  

Instead, she entered what many traditions recognized as a **post-blood phase** — not symbolic, but practical.

No blood meant:
- more physical resilience  
- fewer ritual restrictions  
- greater trust with dangerous knowledge  

This is not romanticism. It is **anthropological reality**.

## Balkan Folklore: The Dangerous Woman Without Blood

In Balkan and South Slavic traditions, older women occupied an ambiguous role.

They were:
- healers  
- curse-breakers  
- bone-washers  
- birth attendants  
- guardians of burial rites  

Many recorded folk beliefs associate older women with:
- weather magic  
- milk and livestock protection  
- warding against the undead  
- night spirits and boundary places  

Importantly, post-menstrual women were often believed to be **less susceptible** to harmful forces because they no longer bled — blood being understood as a point of spiritual access.

This is why many Balkan witch figures are **older women**, not maidens.

## European Witchcraft: From Authority to Threat

In medieval and early modern Europe, menopause quietly shifted from **authority to liability**.

Before witch hunts:
- elder women advised villages  
- managed herbal knowledge  
- attended births and deaths  

During witch persecutions:
- post-menopausal women were disproportionately accused  
- their independence was reframed as deviance  
- their lack of reproductive “use” was treated as suspicion  

The same traits once valued — autonomy, knowledge, emotional containment — became grounds for fear.

Menopause did not change.  
**Power structures did.**

## Indigenous and Non-European Perspectives

### East Asian Traditions
In Chinese medicine, menopause was framed as a **shift of jing and qi**, not loss. Aging women were expected to conserve energy and cultivate wisdom, not remain youthful.

Hot flashes were not pathology — they were **internal heat redistribution**.

### Indigenous North America
Among several Indigenous cultures, elder women:
- became primary herbalists  
- guided rites of passage  
- mediated conflicts  

Their authority often increased after fertility years, not decreased.

### Middle Eastern & Mediterranean Folk Belief
Older women were frequently entrusted with:
- protective charms  
- household magic  
- women’s healing  

Sexual invisibility was not assumed; discretion was.

## The Modern Medical Narrative: What Changed?

Modern medicine approaches menopause through:
- hormone deficiency models  
- productivity loss frameworks  
- symptom suppression  

This framework is not neutral.

It emerged alongside:
- industrial labor demands  
- male-dominated clinical research  
- pharmaceutical profit models  

Symptoms are real. Suffering is real.  
But the **interpretation** of menopause as decline is cultural, not universal.

No folklore tradition described menopausal women as “empty”.

## Witchcraft Philosophies: Conflicting Views

### Folk Witchcraft
Menopause = increased containment, stronger magic, fewer leaks of energy.

### Ceremonial / Occult Traditions
Often silent or dismissive, as these systems prioritized male lineage and symbolic rebirth over biological cycles.

### Modern Neo-Paganism
Sometimes romanticizes the crone, sometimes sanitizes her — often missing the historically uncomfortable parts: rage, sexuality, authority without permission.

### Traditional Herbalism
Focused on stabilizing transitions, not reversing them.

## Why Menopause Became “Invisible”

Menopause became taboo not because it was mysterious — but because it removed women from:
- reproductive usefulness  
- visual desirability  
- economic predictability  

Cultures that feared uncontrollable women labeled them sick.

Cultures that needed them labeled them wise.

## Human Questions About Menopause & Folklore

**Did women suffer during menopause historically?**  
Yes. But suffering was contextualized, not individualized or medicalized.

**Were herbs used to stop menopause?**  
No. Herbs supported sleep, heat, nerves, and strength — not youth preservation.

**Is modern treatment wrong?**  
No. But it is incomplete without cultural context.

**Why are older women central to witch archetypes?**  
Because post-fertile women historically held knowledge without biological obligation.

---

## Final Perspective

Menopause did not erase women.

It unsettled systems that relied on them being predictable.

Folklore remembers this — even when modern narratives forget.
