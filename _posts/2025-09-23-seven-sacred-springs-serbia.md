Eastern Serbia is a land of **limestone gorges and whispering forests**, a place where **water rises from deep caverns and the old gods never truly left**.  

For centuries, villagers have walked miles to gather a single jug of these sacred waters, believing each spring carried its own spirit and cure.

Below are **seven famed springs**—still visited today—where **pilgrimage, herbalism, and pagan survival intertwine**.

---

### 1. **Đavolja Voda – The Devil’s Water, Homolje Mountains**
A warm, iron-rich spring bubbling red like fresh blood.  

*Folklore:* People say it flows from a dragon’s wound. Bathing here after dusk was believed to **banish fevers and “evil winds.”**  

*Herbal tie-in:* Local healers steep **St. John’s wort** in the warm water for joint pain, creating a copper-colored infusion.

### 2. **Rudna Glava Spring – Copper Mother**
Near the prehistoric mines of Rudna Glava, miners once left coins to appease the **“Copper Mother,”** a mountain spirit guarding the ore.  

*Remedy:* Cold compresses soaked in this mineral water were used for **eye infections**.  

*Modern science:* The water is naturally high in trace copper and zinc—both antimicrobial.

### 3. **Bukovik’s Hidden Well**
Reached only by a goat path and a whispered charm.  

On Midsummer Eve, Vlach women **bathed in dew and spring water**, then gathered **mugwort and vervain** for fertility rites.

### 4. **Izvor Svetog Nikole – St. Nicholas Spring**
A Christian chapel crowns the site, but locals say the **old river god still lives beneath the stones**.  

Pilgrims collect water on the saint’s feast day, mixing it with **dry yarrow blossoms** for protection during winter storms.

### 5. **Gornjak Gorge’s Monastic Fountain**
Monks brew a mild tea of **wild mint and nettle**, steeped directly in the spring water.  

Travelers drink it to **“steady the heart”** after mountain climbs.

### 6. **Gamzigrad Thermal Pools**
Known since Roman times.  

Women once performed **moonlit hair-washing rituals** here for thick growth, combining the hot water with a rinse of **nettle and horsetail**—minerals plus silica for the scalp.

Read more about the **time-honored hair remedies** explored in **[10 Timeless Remedies for Hair Loss: Folklore, Herbs, and Science](/folk-hairloss-remedies/)**, where water and herbal infusions were often combined for restorative effects.

### 7. **Timok’s Whispering Eye**
A karst opening where water appears and disappears with the moon.  

Healers claimed it cured **nightmares and sleepless children** when a few drops were added to evening milk.

## Brewing with Holy Water
Throughout the Timok and Homolje valleys, herbalists insist that **infusions made with spring water are stronger**.  

Modern lab tests show these waters often contain **unique mineral profiles** that can indeed change a tea’s flavor and extraction.

### Visiting Today
Many of these springs remain free and wild. Travelers often leave a coin or ribbon “for luck,” echoing rites that predate Christianity.

*If you go:* Bring a small bottle for collecting water, and—as tradition demands—**approach in silence until you’ve taken your first sip.**
