# Lunar Gardening  
**The Moon’s Pull on Root, Leaf, and Spell**

The old women didn’t plant when it was convenient. They watched the sky. They touched the soil and listened to the moon’s drag.  

Not because it was pretty. Because it *worked*.  

The moon pulls the oceans. You think it doesn't pull the water in your seed? In your blood? In the sap of every weed clawing its way out of your cracked garden path?

This isn’t just biodynamics. It’s older than Steiner, older than books, older than the word “gardening” itself.

## Why the Moon Matters

Every living thing is full of water. The moon pulls on that water. Just like it tugs the sea’s tide, it tugs on sap, roots, leaf, marrow.  

Folk farmers and witches alike knew:

- When the **moon waxes**, sap rises. Good for **leafy growth**.  
- When the **moon wanes**, energy sinks. Time for **roots, grounding, and death work**.  
- The **new moon** is rest, shadow, intention.  
- The **full moon** is harvest, climax, blessing or banishment.

Planting by the moon isn’t mystical. It’s biological — with ritual riding shotgun.

## A Witch’s Phase-by-Phase Planting Guide

### 🌑 **New Moon** — *The Void*  
- The soil is quiet. Don’t plant. Rest.  
- Set intentions. Clean tools. Bury old spellwork.  
- In Balkan tradition, a garlic clove planted during the dark moon was used to protect against illness for a full lunar cycle.  
- In hoodoo, seeds are soaked during this time to “wake them up” in silence.

### 🌒 **Waxing Moon** — *Growth and Rise*  
- Time to sow leafy herbs: **basil, tulsi, lemon balm, mugwort**.  
- Water above ground. Feed. Chant.  
- In Slavic gardens, women whispered their worries into dill seeds, believing the herb would “grow solutions.”  
- Good time for binding spells, spell jars, and fertility charms.

### 🌕 **Full Moon** — *Crown and Charge*  
- Harvest. Bless. Cut herbs for magic now — they’re full of power.  
- Bathe plants in moonlight. Cut nettle for strength spells.  
- Some witches soak tools in moon water to sharpen their “eye.”  
- In Sardinia, witches would collect rue under the full moon in silence, to be used only for breaking heavy curses.

### 🌖 **Waning Moon** — *Descent and Root*  
- Plant root crops or deeply rooted herbs: **valerian, dandelion, ashwagandha**.  
- Banish. Prune. Bury offerings.  
- In Appalachian tradition, this was the time to set traps or uproot unwanted plants.  
- A Romanian charm involved burying red thread and bitter seeds to "send away" illness.

## Beyond the Calendar

Moon phase is one thing. But old-time witches used more than dates. They looked for:

- **Animal signs**: Birds circling overhead during waning moon? Don’t plant.  
- **Dreams**: Nightmares before planting meant bad luck.  
- **Soil feel**: If it was “too cold to bleed,” it was too cold to sow.

If you want to garden like a witch, stop checking astrology apps. Get outside. Feel. Wait. Listen.

## Lunar Planting Isn’t Instagram

It's not about posing in a wide-brimmed hat holding kale under moonlight. It's about waiting when you're impatient. Digging when you're exhausted. Trusting the rhythm that your bones still remember, even if your mind forgot.

Want to grow a real witch’s garden?

Plant with the moon, not the mood.

## Coming Soon: Seeds That Know the Sky

We’ll be offering *Artemisia annua* seeds grown by Balkan moonlight — no lab, no soft hands, just bitter medicine raised with ritual. You’ll feel the difference. And so will the land.

## Final Spell

Bury your pride in the new moon.  
Speak your hopes to the waxing tide.  
Harvest with open hands.  
And prune with love, not fear.

The moon doesn’t need belief. It just needs you to pay attention.
