Deep in the **Timok Valley** of Eastern Serbia, where mist settles over oak groves and vineyards, the **Vlach healers (Vlaski vračare)** have guarded a living tradition of magic.  

Anthropologists who worked in villages around Negotin and Zaječar during the 19th and early 20th century recorded **love charms, binding knots, and forest-spirit offerings** that reach back to pre-Christian times.

### Love Spells by the Hearth
A classic Vlach love charm was performed at **midnight on a waxing moon**.  

The healer wound **red wool around a sprig of basil**, whispering the names of the two lovers while the hearth embers glowed.  

The wool was tied in **three knots**, each sealed with a drop of melted beeswax.  

The charm was hidden behind the house beam until the next full moon—symbolizing a bond “as strong as oak roots.”

### Binding Knots for Protection
“**Uvezivanje**”—the knot-binding ritual—was used not only for romance but to **protect infants from the evil eye**.  

Mothers tied a narrow strip of **homespun linen** into nine knots while reciting an old Vlach prayer that mixed Serbian, Romanian, and pre-Slavic words.

Ethnographer Tihomir Đorđević noted that villagers believed the knots acted as “locks” that malevolent forces could not untie.

### Gifts to the Forest Spirits
The Vlachs speak of **šumske majke—forest mothers—ancient feminine beings** who guard springs and medicinal plants.  

Before harvesting powerful herbs like *Artemisia absinthium* or wild rue, a healer would leave a **coin or a strand of hair** at the tree base.  

**Failing to give thanks, elders warned, would cause the herb to “lose its soul,” making it useless.**

### Keeping the Tradition Alive
Many of these rites today are seen only as **cultural heritage** rather than clandestine sorcery. 

Theese days festivals in Negotin and nearby villages invite visitors to witness ritual songs and knot-tying demonstrations, blending respect for the old ways with modern herbal practice.

However, when the outsiders are not looking, **potent magic still takes place across the Timok Valley**.
