In the late 1800s, **Vasa Pelagić** wandered the Serbian countryside carrying more than political pamphlets.  

His *Narodni Učitelj*—*The People’s Teacher*—was equal parts **village schoolbook, moral compass, and herb-soaked spellbook**.  

Our earlier post **[Pelagić Balkan Remedies](/pelagicev-narodni-ucitelj-balkan-remedies)** skippeded these cures to focus on more general guidelines for good life.  

Here we crack open the *later chapters*, where Pelagić jotted stranger counsels: rituals that blur the line between **science, superstition, and sly rebellion**.

### 1. Smoke Baths for Measles
Pelagić describes hanging **juniper and oak branches over smoldering coals** while a sick child inhales the fragrant smoke.  

Modern science backs part of this: juniper wood releases **antimicrobial compounds** such as α-pinene, and oak tannins have mild antiviral action.  

While we wouldn’t treat measles this way today, the disinfecting smoke likely **reduced airborne contagion** in cramped homes.

### 2. Morning Dew for a Clear Complexion
“Before sunrise,” he wrote, “**wash your face with meadow dew** to banish freckles and dullness.”  

Dew is simply condensed atmospheric moisture, but the **cool water, gentle massage, and lack of harsh soap** indeed soothe irritated skin.  

Dermatologists now tout *cold-water therapy* for reducing inflammation—Pelagić was ahead of the spa trend.

### 3. Walnut-Leaf Hair Rinse
Women were told to boil **green walnut husks and leaves** for glossy, dark hair.  

Science nods again: walnut hulls contain **juglone**, a natural dye and mild antifungal, explaining their centuries of use as a **plant-based hair toner**.

### 4. Bread-and-Salt Oath for Peace
To reconcile neighbors, Pelagić advised breaking a loaf sprinkled with salt while reciting a short prayer.  

Folklorists note that **bread and salt are pan-Slavic symbols of hospitality**.  

Sharing them “dissolves quarrels,” reinforcing the social chemistry of forgiveness more than any molecule.

### 5. Kitchen Ash for Garden Pests
He recommended sprinkling **wood ash** around cabbages to deter slugs.  

Modern organic gardeners agree: ash raises soil pH and creates a dry barrier that pests dislike—**a 19th-century permaculture hack** still valid today.

**Why These Lessons Endure**  
Pelagić blurred **folk magic and rational hygiene**, teaching peasants to trust both **herb lore and self-education**.  

Some remedies hold scientific weight; others serve as **rituals of care and community**, which science now recognizes as powerful for mental health.
