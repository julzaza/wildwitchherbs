In the late 1800s, Vasa Pelagić wandered the Serbian countryside carrying more than political pamphlets. His *Narodni Učitelj*—The People’s Teacher—was equal parts **village schoolbook, moral compass, and herb-soaked spellbook**.  

While our previous post explored general guidance for everyday wellness, here we uncover the stranger chapters, revealing **folk rituals, unusual remedies, and practices that blur the line between science, superstition, and rebellion**.

## Folk Remedies and Hidden Rituals

### 1. Smoke Baths for Measles
> A child sits near a clay brazier with juniper and oak branches smoldering above the coals.

Juniper smoke contains **α-pinene and other antimicrobial compounds**, while oak bark releases tannins with mild antiviral properties. Though not a medical treatment today, disinfecting smoke in cramped homes may have slowed contagion—where tradition and hygiene quietly meet.

### 2. Morning Dew for a Clear Complexion
> “Before sunrise, wash the face with meadow dew to banish freckles, tiredness, and dullness.”

Cold dew is not mystical, but **cold-water constriction, gentle massage, and lack of harsh soaps** soothe irritated skin. Pelagić anticipated modern cold-water skincare practices across Europe.

### 3. Walnut-Leaf Hair Rinse
> Boil green walnut husks and leaves; pour over hair to deepen color and add shine.

**Juglone** acts as a natural dye, and walnut leaves provide mild antifungal and antibacterial benefits. This darkening rinse remains a traditional Balkan herbal remedy.

### 4. Bread-and-Salt Oath for Peace
> To resolve conflicts, neighbors break a loaf sprinkled with salt while reciting a short reconciliation prayer.

Bread and salt are **pan-Slavic symbols of life and hospitality**. This ritual fosters social healing rather than biochemical change.

---

### 5. Kitchen Ash for Garden Pests
> Scatter wood ash around cabbages to deter slugs.

Ash raises soil pH, creates a dry barrier, and acts as a light fertilizer—a **19th-century permaculture hack still used in Balkan gardens**.

## Why These Cures Endure
Pelagić lived in a time when **science and folk belief coexisted daily**. His remedies combine observation, plant knowledge, ritual, and communal ethics, showing how villagers used what they had: herbs, forest, fields, and each other.  

Some remedies have biochemical basis; others succeed through **ritual, meaning, and community care**—practical wisdom that still inspires modern herbalists.
