    - question: "Did witch hunts target menopausal women?"
      answer: "No. Witch hunts disproportionately targeted older women, many of whom were post-childbearing, but menopause itself was not a cause of accusation."
    - question: "Why were older women more vulnerable?"
      answer: "Age often coincided with widowhood, poverty, lack of protection, and social isolation—factors that increased suspicion."
    - question: "Were healers and midwives targeted?"
      answer: "Some were, but many accused women were not healers. The pattern is more social than professional."

## The Claim That Needs Correction

You will often hear it said:
> *“Witch hunts targeted menopausal women.”*

This is **not false**, but it is **incomplete** — and often misleading.

The truth is sharper, more uncomfortable, and more revealing.

## What Is Historically Supported (Strong Evidence)

### **1. Older women were disproportionately accused**
Across early modern Europe, records show:

- Most accused women were **middle-aged to elderly**
- Many were **post-reproductive**, widowed, or childless
- Average ages often ranged from **45–65**

This pattern appears in:
- German territories  
- Scotland  
- Switzerland  
- Parts of France  
- Scandinavia  
- The Balkans (later, with local variations)

✔️ **Yes — non-fertile or post-childbearing women were overrepresented.**

---

### **2. Widowhood mattered more than menopause**
This is crucial.

What placed women at risk was:
- Loss of male protection  
- Economic marginality  
- Social isolation  

Menopause often *correlated* with these conditions — but it did not cause them.

A fertile widow with land could be accused.
A menopausal woman with strong kin could be safe.

> **Social position, not biology, determined risk.**

---

### **3. Healers and midwives were targeted — but not exclusively**
This matters because popular narratives distort it.

- Some midwives were accused  
- Many were not  
- Many accused women were not healers at all  

However, women associated with:
- Birth  
- Death  
- Blood  
- Folk remedies  

*did* face heightened suspicion in certain regions.

This was not about medicine — it was about boundary proximity.

## What Is Partially True (And Often Misused)

### **4. Menopause as symbolic danger**
Menopause was never named as an accusation.

But early modern belief systems framed older women as:
- Physically altered  
- Spiritually unstable  
- Less governed by social duty  

Under Galenic medicine, post-menopausal women were described as:
- “Dry”
- “Hot”
- Melancholic  

This symbolism fed fear — **indirectly**.

---

## What Witch Hunts Actually Policed

Witch hunts were not about fertility.

They were about:
- Disorder  
- Refusal  
- Survival without permission  

Older women were dangerous not because they no longer birthed —  
but because they no longer fit.

---

## The Pattern That Repeats

The women most often accused were:
- Too old to be useful  
- Too poor to be protected  
- Too knowledgeable to be ignored  
- Too independent to be controlled  

Menopause was not the crime.  
It was the **context**.

## Human FAQ

### Were young women accused?
Yes, especially in cases involving sexuality or moral panic — but they were not the majority.

### Were witch hunts about controlling reproduction?
Indirectly. They enforced social order, not fertility outcomes.

### Is the “menopause witch” narrative accurate?
Only when framed as social vulnerability, not biological blame.
