# 7 Witchy Herbs from Around the World  
**And the Stories They Tell**

Some herbs weren’t grown for tea. They were grown to speak, to shield, to hex, to heal. In every corner of the world, witches, midwives, shamans, and root-workers knew which leaves to burn when the air grew strange, which roots to bury when someone died, which seeds to plant under silence.

These seven herbs didn’t come from Pinterest. They come from bloodlines. From field chants. From whispered names passed down behind closed doors.

## Guinea Hen Weed (*Petiveria alliacea*)

**Region:** Caribbean, Central & South America  
**Uses:** Spirit protection, banishing, fever remedy  

Known as *Anamu* in Vodou and Santería, this pungent root is feared and revered. Burned to scatter spirits, brewed to break hexes, or worn for protection — it’s not just a folk remedy, it’s a spiritual wall.

## Lovage (*Levisticum officinale*)

**Region:** Eastern & Central Europe  
**Uses:** Love spells, protection, purification  

On Midsummer nights, Slavic girls would wash their hair in lovage water and leap through fire, hoping to draw in the right love and ward off bad luck. It’s a wedding herb. A grave herb. A plant of thresholds.

## African Dream Root (*Silene capensis*)

**Region:** South Africa  
**Uses:** Dreamwork, ancestral communication  

Xhosa healers take this root to connect with the dead — not for sleep, but for *revelation*. It’s not a gentle dream herb; it’s a doorway. You take it when you’re ready to listen.

## Blue Vervain (*Verbena hastata*)

**Region:** North America  
**Uses:** Protection, divination, spiritual calming  

Cherokee healers saw it as sacred. European Druids thought it divine. Carried in hoodoo to guard the heart, and brewed to still the spirit. Vervain was for warriors and diviners alike.

## Holy Basil (*Tulsi*, *Ocimum sanctum*)

**Region:** India  
**Uses:** Protection, purification, daily devotion  

In Hindu homes, tulsi is not a plant. It’s family. Watered with prayer, grown in a courtyard altar, and believed to carry the spirit of Lakshmi. Its presence alone shifts the energy of a space.

## Boldo (*Peumus boldus*)

**Region:** Chile  
**Uses:** Cleansing, awakening, liver strength  

To the Mapuche and Chilean curanderas, boldo wasn’t just a detox tea — it was for clearing *spiritual congestion*. Its bitter leaves banish what’s heavy. Burn it, drink it, plant it at your gate.

## Yarrow (*Achillea millefolium*)

**Region:** Europe, Asia, North America  
**Uses:** Wound healing, divination, fertility protection  

Achilles carried it into war. Chinese diviners used the stalks. Slavic women stuffed it in mattresses to guard fertility. Yarrow is blood-kin to every healer who ever held a blade or gave birth.

## Final Words

These herbs carry memory — not just medicine.  
They weren’t grown to be pretty. They were grown for strength, survival, spirit.

If you plant them, know what you’re planting. And why.
