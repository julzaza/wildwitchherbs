## The Healing Witch

The witch was a healer before she was ever feared. Her hut may have stood at the edge of the woods, but her remedies were at the heart of village life. She worked with what she had—roots pulled from riverbanks, flowers gathered at dawn, seeds whispered over in the moonlight.

Below are the plants most beloved by witches, folk healers, and cunning women throughout history—each one known to mend not just the body, but the spirit, the heart, and sometimes even fate.

## ✦ Final Thought

These herbs are more than green things in bottles. They are ancestors with leaves. They are bridges between spirit and body, story and science. Each one has served witches, midwives, and healers for centuries.

But healing doesn’t come from memorizing herbs. It comes from tending to them. Listening to them. Honoring their lives as you honor your own.

Let your apothecary be your altar. Let your healing be a ritual.
