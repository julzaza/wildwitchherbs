## What Smudging Actually Is
Smudging is a **North American Indigenous ceremony**, practiced by nations such as:

- Lakota  
- Ojibwe  
- Cree  
- Dene  
- Cherokee  
- Navajo  
- Coast Salish  

While each nation is different, smudging generally includes:

- prayer or song  
- ceremonial herbs (white sage, sweetgrass, cedar, tobacco)  
- a lineage of teaching passed through elders  
- a sacred cultural framework  

If you weren’t taught by that community, you are **not smudging**.  
You are practicing **your own culture’s smoke tradition**.

## What Smoke Cleansing Is  
Across the world, people burned herbs for:

- banishment  
- healing  
- blessing  
- boundary protection  
- ancestral veneration  
- seasonal rites  
- newborn purification  
- preparing ritual spaces  

The method is global — but the herbs change with the land.

Below is a worldwide view of smoke cleansing traditions.

## Why White Sage Is Not Necessary  
White sage (**Salvia apiana**) is sacred to several Indigenous nations, and commercial harvesting has endangered wild populations.

You never need white sage.  
You have powerful herbs wherever you live.

That also means knowing which plants can be dangerous to burn — check our comprehensive guide to **[Herbs Never to Burn in Ritual](/never-burn-herbs/)** for safety and clarity.

## How to Perform a Global-Friendly Smoke Cleansing Ritual  
This method respects worldwide traditions without appropriating Indigenous ceremony.

1. **Choose a local or ethically sourced herb.**  
2. **Set one clear intention.**  
3. **Burn loose herbs in a heat-proof bowl or censer.**  
4. Move **clockwise** to bless or **counterclockwise** to banish.  
5. Focus on **doors, windows, corners, and your bed**.  
6. Close the ritual with a grounding phrase, such as:

*“Smoke of earth and leaf of land,  
Clear this space and bless it clean.”*

## When to Use the Word “Smoke Cleansing”  
Use “smudging” only if:

- you belong to an Indigenous nation **and**  
- you were taught the ceremony by that community  

If not, “smoke cleansing” is the correct and respectful term.
