## What Smudging Actually Is
Smudging is a **North American Indigenous ceremony**, practiced by nations such as:

- Lakota  
- Ojibwe  
- Cree  
- Dene  
- Cherokee  
- Navajo  
- Coast Salish  

While each nation is different, smudging generally includes:

- prayer or song  
- ceremonial herbs (white sage, sweetgrass, cedar, tobacco)  
- a lineage of teaching passed through elders  
- a sacred cultural framework  

If you weren’t taught by that community, you are **not smudging**.  
You are practicing **your own culture’s smoke tradition**.

## What Smoke Cleansing Is  
Across the world, people burned herbs for:

- banishment  
- healing  
- blessing  
- boundary protection  
- ancestral veneration  
- seasonal rites  
- newborn purification  
- preparing ritual spaces  

The method is global — but the herbs change with the land.

Below is a worldwide view of smoke cleansing traditions.

## Why White Sage Is Not Necessary  
White sage (**Salvia apiana**) is sacred to several Indigenous nations, and commercial harvesting has endangered wild populations.

You never need white sage.  
You have powerful herbs wherever you live.

## How to Perform a Global-Friendly Smoke Cleansing Ritual  
This method respects worldwide traditions without appropriating Indigenous ceremony.

1. **Choose a local or ethically sourced herb.**  
2. **Set one clear intention.**  
3. **Burn loose herbs in a heat-proof bowl or censer.**  
4. Move **clockwise** to bless or **counterclockwise** to banish.  
5. Focus on **doors, windows, corners, and your bed**.  
6. Close the ritual with a grounding phrase, such as:

*“Smoke of earth and leaf of land,  
Clear this space and bless it clean.”*

## When to Use the Word “Smoke Cleansing”  
Use “smudging” only if:

- you belong to an Indigenous nation **and**  
- you were taught the ceremony by that community  

If not, “smoke cleansing” is the correct and respectful term.
