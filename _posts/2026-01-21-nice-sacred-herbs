## The Nine Sacred Herbs Were Never a List — They Were a Spell

When people ask, *“What are the nine sacred herbs?”*  
They are already asking the wrong way.

This was never a checklist.  
It was **a working charm**.

The Nine Herbs were spoken, crushed, mixed, and activated through ritual — recorded in one of the oldest surviving European magical healing texts: **the Lacnunga**, written in Old English around the 10th century.

This is not reconstructed witchcraft.  
This is documented practice.

## The Nine Herbs Charm (Historical Context)

The charm appears as a poetic incantation used against:
- Poison
- Infection
- Disease
- Malevolent forces
- Spiritual affliction

It blends:
- Pagan plant lore
- Spoken magic
- Early Christian overlay
- Practical herbal medicine

This reflects how real witchcraft survived — by adapting.

---

## The Nine Sacred Herbs Named in the Charm

The charm names nine plants, each chosen for its **protective and healing power**.

### 1. Mugwort (*Artemisia vulgaris*)
Called *“the oldest of herbs.”*  
Used for protection, poison, and spiritual attack.

Mugwort opens and guards thresholds — bodily and spiritual.

---

### 2. Waybroad (*Plantago major*)
Known today as plantain.

A classic wound herb used to draw out infection, venom, and disease.  
Still used in folk first aid across Europe.

---

### 3. Lamb’s Cress (*Cardamine hirsuta*)
A cleansing, bitter plant.

Associated with purification and resilience — helping the body fight off illness.

---

### 4. Attorlothe
A debated plant name, often linked to **cockspur grass** or bitter field plants.

Its role appears to be **disruption of illness**, rather than nourishment.

---

### 5. Maythe
Often associated with chamomile or similar calming plants.

Used to cool inflammation and soothe internal imbalance.

---

### 6. Nettle (*Urtica dioica*)
A protector and purifier.

Nettle strengthens blood, wards off malefic forces, and restores vitality after weakness.

---

### 7. Crab-Apple (*Malus sylvestris*)
The wild apple — not sweetness, but sharpness.

Associated with cleansing, boundary-setting, and restoring order.

---

### 8. Chervil (*Anthriscus cerefolium*)
A spring herb tied to renewal.

Used to restore circulation and vitality after illness.

---

### 9. Fennel (*Foeniculum vulgare*)
A powerful digestive and protective plant.

Fennel guards against poison and was used to strengthen the body’s defenses.

---

## How the Nine Herbs Were Prepared

The charm instructs the healer to:
- Grind the herbs into dust
- Mix them with old soap and apple juice
- Sing or speak the incantation while preparing

This is **embodied magic**:
- Touch
- Voice
- Intention
- Plant spirit

Not symbolic.  
Not decorative.

---

## Why Nine?

Nine is a **threshold number** across Indo-European traditions:
- Completion
- Protection
- Transformation
- Crossing states

Nine herbs meant **total coverage** — body, spirit, and fate.

---

## Pagan Roots, Christian Overlay

The charm invokes:
- Woden (Odin)
- Sacred numbers
- Healing plants

Later manuscripts added Christian framing — a survival tactic, not conversion.

The magic remained intact.

---

## Why This Matters for Modern Witchcraft

The Nine Herbs Charm proves:
- Witchcraft was medicinal
- Herbalism was magical
- Spells were practical
- Plants were allies, not symbols

Many of these herbs still appear throughout Wild Witch Herbs:
- Mugwort
- Plantain
- Nettle
- Fennel
- Artemisia species

This charm is a **root document** — not a curiosity.

---

## How to Work With the Nine Herbs Today (Respectfully)

Do not recreate blindly.

Instead:
- Study the plants individually
- Use one or two at a time
- Speak intention clearly
- Honor lineage, not aesthetics

This is ancestral work — not cosplay.

---

---

## Final Words

The Nine Sacred Herbs were not chosen at random.

They were tested through famine, war, plague, and survival.

This charm endured because it worked — not because it was pretty.

If you want real witchcraft, this is where it begins.

Not with candles.  
With plants.  
With words.  
With memory.
