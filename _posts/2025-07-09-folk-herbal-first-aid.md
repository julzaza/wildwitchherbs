Long before antiseptic wipes and factory-sealed pills, people turned to what they had: leaves, roots, resins, and instinct. **The original first responders were witches, midwives, and grandmothers** — women who knew what to rub on a sting, steep for a fever, or smear on a burn. 

Call it folk herbalism, witchcraft, or old country know-how — **these remedies were meant to work**. 

It was the kind of healing that smells, stains your fingers, and works better than you'd expect.

**These treatments passed from grandmother to granddaughter.** Others came in dreams.

This is your **folk herbal first aid guide** — time to take notes from witches and generational healers.

## For Cuts and Scrapes

### Yarrow (Achillea millefolium)  
Called ‘soldier’s herb,’ it stopped bleeding in European battlefields and was also used in North American folk medicine for wounds. Powder the dried leaves or apply fresh bruised ones directly to the wound. It also wards off infection and is gentle on skin.

### Plantain (Plantago major/lanceolata)  
That “weed” underfoot? Plantain pulls out dirt, venom, and infection. Chew it into a poultice or mash with a bit of water and press onto wounds. 
Bonus: it soothes pain almost instantly.

**Witch Tip:** Add a pinch of salt to plantain poultices for stronger drawing power — especially for splinters or infected cuts.

---

## For Bruises and Swelling

### Arnica (Arnica montana)  
Used externally (never internally!), arnica reduces bruising, swelling, and sprains. Infuse it into oil and apply sparingly — it’s powerful.

### Comfrey (Symphytum officinale)  
Known as “bone-knit,” comfrey accelerates healing for bruises and even broken bones — but don’t use on deep wounds. It seals skin fast and can trap infection.

**Witch Tip:** Wrap comfrey poultices in flannel and chant the old rhyme: *“Comfrey bind, comfrey heal, bone and bruise to quickly seal.”*

---

## For Fevers

### Elderflower (Sambucus nigra)  
Cooling, diaphoretic, and antiviral — elderflower helps “sweat out” a fever gently. Steep as a tea with peppermint or yarrow for stronger effect.

### Linden (Tilia spp.)  
Linden flower is calming, soothing, and safe for children. It lowers fever while relaxing the nerves and helping sleep.

**Witch Tip:** Combine equal parts linden, elderflower, and yarrow to make an old-school fever tea. Drink warm under a blanket and let the sweat do its work.

---

## For Bites and Stings

### Plantain (again!)  
Its ability to draw venom and soothe pain makes it your #1 plant for bites and bee stings.

### Basil (Ocimum basilicum)  
Crushed basil leaves reduce itching and swelling from mosquito or spider bites. Chew and apply, or bruise them with a stone.

### Lavender Essential Oil  
A rare essential oil safe to apply directly (in tiny amounts). Soothes wasp stings, burns, and bites.

**Witch Tip:** For spiritual cleansing after a bite or sting (especially from snakes or aggressive animals), burn rosemary and juniper together to cleanse fear from the aura.

## Burns, Scalds, and Sunburns

### Plantain (*Plantago major*) 

Major star of this Folk First Aid Kit, plantain leaves are a classic folk remedy for burns. Crushed fresh and applied directly, they draw out heat and reduce swelling. This was often done on the spot — chewed into a poultice and slapped onto the skin. 

If you're foraging or growing your own, this is one to always have on hand.

### Calendula (*Calendula officinalis*)

A plant of the sun, and often used in folk magic for protection, calendula also calms inflammation. Its petals are used in salves and infused oils to soothe minor burns, sunburns, and skin irritation.

Steeped in oil and strained, calendula becomes a powerful skin healer.

### Aloe Vera

While not native to colder climates, aloe has traveled into global folk herbalism. Its cooling gel is used to soothe fresh burns, especially in dry or sun-exposed regions. Slice a leaf and apply the gel directly to the skin.

## Warnings And Wisdom

### Do Not Use on Fresh Burns

- Oils or butters (like olive, coconut, or ghee) — they trap heat and may worsen the injury.
- Essential oils — too harsh and concentrated for broken or inflamed skin.

Severe burns should always be treated by a professional. These remedies are for mild kitchen mishaps, minor scalds, or sunburns.

- Don’t use **comfrey** on infected wounds  
- **Arnica** is toxic if taken internally  
- Always check for **allergies**  
- Wildcraft **ethically** and identify plants 100% before using

## Herbal Allies For Emotional Support

Physical wounds were rarely treated alone in folk traditions — many healers believed emotional shock, grief, and fear slowed recovery, which is why plants were also chosen for the heart and nerves, not just the skin. 

If you want to explore herbs beneficial for the mind and spirit, see **[Herbs For Emotional Healing](/witchy-herbs-anxiety-grief-emotional-healing/)**.

## Final Thoughts

This is not a replacement for emergency care. It’s a revival of **what our ancestors did when there was no other option** — and what many still do today.

You don’t need white coats or clinic lights to start healing. You need dirt under your nails, a jar of dried yarrow, and a will to learn.

Build your apothecary. Learn your plants. And remember — you come from a long line of witches who knew how to heal.

**If these ancestral remedies speak to you, consider sharing them with fellow witches or bookmarking this guide for your own first aid apothecary.**
