Long before antiseptic wipes and factory-sealed pills, people turned to what they had: leaves, roots, resins, and instinct. The original first responders were witches, midwives, and grandmothers — women who knew what to rub on a sting, steep for a fever, or smear on a burn.

We’re talking **smoke, spit, pine pitch, and raw garlic**. The kind of medicine that smells like it works. This is your **folk herbal first aid guide** — gritty, grounded, and real.

## For Cuts and Scrapes

**Yarrow (Achillea millefolium)**  
Yarrow is legendary for stopping bleeding — soldiers carried it into battle. Powder the dried leaves or apply fresh bruised ones directly to the wound. It also wards off infection and is gentle on skin.

**Plantain (Plantago major/lanceolata)**  
That “weed” underfoot? Plantain pulls out dirt, venom, and infection. Chew it into a poultice or mash with a bit of water and press onto wounds. Bonus: it soothes pain almost instantly.

**Witch Tip:** Add a pinch of salt to plantain poultices for stronger drawing power — especially for splinters or infected cuts.

---

## For Bruises and Swelling

**Arnica (Arnica montana)**  
Used externally (never internally!), arnica reduces bruising, swelling, and sprains. Infuse it into oil and apply sparingly — it’s powerful.

**Comfrey (Symphytum officinale)**  
Known as “bone-knit,” comfrey accelerates healing for bruises and even broken bones — but don’t use on deep wounds. It seals skin fast and can trap infection.

**Witch Tip:** Wrap comfrey poultices in flannel and chant the old rhyme: *“Comfrey bind, comfrey heal, bone and bruise to quickly seal.”*

## For Fevers

**Elderflower (Sambucus nigra)**  
Cooling, diaphoretic, and antiviral — elderflower helps “sweat out” a fever gently. Steep as a tea with peppermint or yarrow for stronger effect.

**Linden (Tilia spp.)**  
Linden flower is calming, soothing, and safe for children. It lowers fever while relaxing the nerves and helping sleep.

**Witch Tip:** Combine equal parts linden, elderflower, and yarrow to make an old-school fever tea. Drink warm under a blanket and let the sweat do its work.

## For Bites and Stings

**Plantain (again!)**  
Its ability to draw venom and soothe pain makes it your #1 plant for bites and bee stings.

**Basil (Ocimum basilicum)**  
Crushed basil leaves reduce itching and swelling from mosquito or spider bites. Chew and apply, or bruise them with a stone.

**Lavender Essential Oil**  
A rare essential oil safe to apply directly (in tiny amounts). Soothes wasp stings, burns, and bites.

**Witch Tip:** For spiritual cleansing after a bite or sting (especially from snakes or aggressive animals), burn rosemary and juniper together to cleanse fear from the aura.

## How to Prepare a Folk First Aid Kit

Build yours over time. Keep it small, sacred, and real.

- Dried **yarrow**, **plantain**, and **elderflower**
- Infused oils: **comfrey**, **arnica**, and **lavender**
- Small tinctures: **echinacea**, **valerian** (for shock), **goldenseal** (for infection)
- Tools: muslin cloth, mortar & pestle, small glass jars
- Optional: beeswax for making salves

Label everything, charge them under the moon, and always test on yourself before offering to others.

##  Warnings & Wisdom

- Don’t use **comfrey** on infected wounds  
- **Arnica** is toxic if taken internally  
- Always check for **allergies**  
- Wildcraft **ethically** and identify plants 100% before using

Herbal medicine is potent, real, and not always safe — which is exactly why it works. Treat it with the reverence it deserves.

## Final Thoughts

This is not a replacement for emergency care. It’s a revival of **what our ancestors did when there was no other option** — and what many still do today.

You don’t need white coats or clinic lights to start healing. You need dirt under your nails, a jar of dried yarrow, and a will to learn.

Build your apothecary. Learn your plants. And remember — you come from a long line of witches who knew how to heal.
