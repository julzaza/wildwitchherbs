Long before antiseptic wipes and factory-sealed pills, people turned to what they had: leaves, roots, resins, and instinct. The original first responders were witches, midwives, and grandmothers — women who knew what to rub on a sting, steep for a fever, or smear on a burn. 

Call it folk herbalism, witchcraft, or old country know-how — these remedies were meant to work. 

It was the kind of healing that smells, stains your fingers, and works better than you'd expect.

These treatments passed from grandmother to granddaughter. Others came in dreams.

This is your **folk herbal first aid guide** — time to take notes from witches and generational healers.

## For Cuts and Scrapes

### Yarrow (Achillea millefolium)  
Yarrow is legendary for stopping bleeding — soldiers carried it into battle. Powder the dried leaves or apply fresh bruised ones directly to the wound. It also wards off infection and is gentle on skin.

### Plantain (Plantago major/lanceolata)  
That “weed” underfoot? Plantain pulls out dirt, venom, and infection. Chew it into a poultice or mash with a bit of water and press onto wounds. Bonus: it soothes pain almost instantly.

**Witch Tip:** Add a pinch of salt to plantain poultices for stronger drawing power — especially for splinters or infected cuts.

---

## For Bruises and Swelling

### Arnica (Arnica montana)  
Used externally (never internally!), arnica reduces bruising, swelling, and sprains. Infuse it into oil and apply sparingly — it’s powerful.

### Comfrey (Symphytum officinale)  
Known as “bone-knit,” comfrey accelerates healing for bruises and even broken bones — but don’t use on deep wounds. It seals skin fast and can trap infection.

**Witch Tip:** Wrap comfrey poultices in flannel and chant the old rhyme: *“Comfrey bind, comfrey heal, bone and bruise to quickly seal.”*

## For Fevers

### Elderflower (Sambucus nigra)  
Cooling, diaphoretic, and antiviral — elderflower helps “sweat out” a fever gently. Steep as a tea with peppermint or yarrow for stronger effect.

### Linden (Tilia spp.)  
Linden flower is calming, soothing, and safe for children. It lowers fever while relaxing the nerves and helping sleep.

**Witch Tip:** Combine equal parts linden, elderflower, and yarrow to make an old-school fever tea. Drink warm under a blanket and let the sweat do its work.

## For Bites and Stings

### Plantain (again!)  
Its ability to draw venom and soothe pain makes it your #1 plant for bites and bee stings.

### Basil (Ocimum basilicum)  
Crushed basil leaves reduce itching and swelling from mosquito or spider bites. Chew and apply, or bruise them with a stone.

### Lavender Essential Oil  
A rare essential oil safe to apply directly (in tiny amounts). Soothes wasp stings, burns, and bites.

**Witch Tip:** For spiritual cleansing after a bite or sting (especially from snakes or aggressive animals), burn rosemary and juniper together to cleanse fear from the aura.

## Burns, Scalds, and Sunburns

Before silver creams and spray bottles, burn remedies came from the garden, the forest, and the kitchen hearth. Folk healers knew which plants cooled fire and which sealed in the wound — and which ones to avoid.

### Plantain (*Plantago major*) Major Star of the Folk First Aid Kit

Used across Europe and the Balkans, plantain leaves are a classic folk remedy for burns. Crushed fresh and applied directly, they draw out heat and reduce swelling. This was often done on the spot — chewed into a poultice and slapped onto the skin.

If you're foraging or growing your own, this is one to always have on hand.

### Calendula (*Calendula officinalis*)

A plant of the sun, and often used in folk magic for protection, calendula also calms inflammation. Its petals are used in salves and infused oils to soothe minor burns, sunburns, and skin irritation.

Steeped in oil and strained, calendula becomes a powerful skin healer.

### Aloe Vera

While not native to colder climates, aloe has traveled into global folk herbalism. Its cooling gel is used to soothe fresh burns, especially in dry or sun-exposed regions. Slice a leaf and apply the gel directly to the skin.

## Do Not Use on Fresh Burns

- Oils or butters (like olive, coconut, or ghee) — they trap heat and may worsen the injury.
- Essential oils — too harsh and concentrated for broken or inflamed skin.

Severe burns should always be treated by a professional. These remedies are for mild kitchen mishaps, minor scalds, or sunburns.

## How to Prepare a Folk First Aid Kit

Build yours over time. Keep it small, sacred, and real.

- Dried **yarrow**, **plantain**, and **elderflower**
- Infused oils: **comfrey**, **arnica**, and **lavender**
- Small tinctures: **echinacea**, **valerian** (for shock), **goldenseal** (for infection)
- Tools: muslin cloth, mortar & pestle, small glass jars
- Optional: beeswax for making salves

Label everything, charge them under the moon, and always test on yourself before offering to others.

- Don’t use **comfrey** on infected wounds  
- **Arnica** is toxic if taken internally  
- Always check for **allergies**

## Final Thoughts

This is not a replacement for emergency care. It’s a revival of **what our ancestors did when there was no other option** — and what many still do today.

You don’t need white coats or clinic lights to start healing. You need dirt under your nails, a jar of dried yarrow, and a will to learn.

Build your apothecary. Learn your plants. And remember — you come from a long line of witches who knew how to heal.
