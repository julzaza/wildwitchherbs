Long before apps and pretty planners told us when to sow seeds, people watched the moon. They did it because it worked.

Lunar gardening is practical magic. The moon affects ocean tides, animal behavior, even sleep. It affects plants too — especially the water in their cells, the direction of their growth, and the energy they hold when you cut or harvest them.

It’s not about following every rule to the letter. It’s about tuning in to something older than agriculture itself.

## Why Moon Phases Matter in the Garden

Every plant responds to light, water, and gravity — and the moon plays a role in all three. That’s not folklore, that’s physics.

- During the **waxing moon**, sap rises. Herbs grow upward. Energy moves toward stems and leaves.
- During the **waning moon**, the pull turns downward. Roots deepen. Energy consolidates.
- The **new moon** is for rest and setting intention.
- The **full moon** brings peak energy, clarity, and harvest.

It’s the difference between planting something that thrives and something that barely makes it.

## Moon Phases and What to Do

### New Moon – The Void  
- No planting. Just planning.  
- Bless the soil. Light a candle. Rest.  
- In Balkan villages, women once laid their hands on bare ground during the dark moon, asking it to take grief or sickness before the new crop.

### Waxing Moon – Rise and Grow  
- Plant herbs that grow above ground: **mugwort**, **motherwort**, **tulsi**, **chamomile**.  
- Good for charms, attraction spells, strength work.  
- In parts of India, seeds were soaked and whispered over during waxing moons — not prayer, but pact.

### Full Moon – Height and Harvest  
- Harvest leafy plants and flowers.  
- Make tinctures, salves, or bundles for drying.  
- In rural Romania, full moon harvests were used for love spells — especially when picking verbena or yarrow from crossroads.

### Waning Moon – Cut and Root  
- Time for pruning, uprooting, planting root crops.  
- Best for banishing, binding, endings.  
- In Caribbean Vodou, offerings were sometimes buried under herbs planted during the waning moon, tying intention into the roots.

## Planting Rituals Across Cultures

Witches didn’t plant just by phase. They planted with **offerings**, **spit**, **songs**, and **superstition** — all tied to the moon.

- **Andean farmers** spit on coca seeds before burying them — their breath sealed fate.  
- **Slavic midwives** wrapped wormwood seeds in linen and buried them before dawn, whispering names of ancestors to protect the garden.  
- In **Yoruba land**, offerings of honey and cowrie were buried before planting sacred herbs used in *Ifá* divination.  
- **Jewish mystics** aligned sowing with the Hebrew lunar calendar. In some Kabbalistic circles, prayers were recited before planting herbs associated with specific *sefirot* (cosmic attributes), such as sage for *Chokhmah* (wisdom) or hyssop for *Gevurah* (severity).

These rituals weren’t extras. They were the work.

## Moon Herbs with Meaning

Here are a few herbs tied to the moon — culturally and magically:

- **Artemisia (all kinds)** – Vision, clarity, protection. Burned on full moons or soaked under moonlight and added to baths in Balkan and Chinese traditions.  
- **Hyssop** – Purification. Used in Kabbalah and Christian rituals alike. “Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean.”  
- **Pennyroyal** – Female power and protection. Tied to old English midwives and also used by Greek priestesses of Hecate.  
- **Mugwort** – Dreamwork and divination. Used globally: in Slavic solstice rites, Japanese purification baths, and Native American smudges.  
- **Mandrake** – Dangerous magic. Said to cry when pulled. In Jewish folklore, it was used to conceive — not without risk.

## If You Don’t Have Land

Don’t let that stop you.

Lunar planting can happen in:

- A jar on your windowsill  
- A pot on a balcony  
- An abandoned patch of dirt near the train tracks

Magic doesn’t need permission. Just timing.

## You’re Not Gardening. You’re Remembering.

Every lunar planting is an act of memory — yours, your ancestors’, or the land’s.

So plant when the moon pulls, not when the seeds' packet says so.

That’s how witches do it.
