# How Witches Used Evergreen Trees Before Christmas Existed

Modern people tend to imagine the evergreen tree as the Christmas tree—domestic, decorated, and dressed with lights. But the evergreen was revered long before Christianity touched Europe. It was **the witch’s winter tree**, a symbol of defiance against death, a physical embodiment of life that refused to bow to the season of bones and hunger.

Long before the birth of Christmas traditions, centuries before the word “Yule” entered English, evergreens were carried, burned, buried, kissed, carved, and used in spells across the continent. They were not decorative. They were not festive.

They were **protection**, **boundary**, **medicine**, and **magic**.

This is the story of how witches used evergreen trees before Christmas ever existed.

## The Evergreen as a Pre-Christian Symbol: Life That Refuses to Die

In pre-Christian Europe, the winter world belonged to the dead.

The cold pushed people inward. The fields slept. The sun retreated.  
Nothing green survived—except the evergreens.

To the old witches, this was not a small detail.  
It was a sign:  
a tree that could defy winter could defy the spirits winter carried.

Evergreens were believed to:

- Guard the home against wandering winter spirits  
- Ward off illness that rose when the sun was weakest  
- Anchor the life force of a household  
- Protect livestock from the “wintering winds,” the malevolent breaths of unseen beings  

In Slavic and Balkan folklore, evergreen branches were hung above doors to stop ghosts, witches, and the wind-borne dead from entering. In the Alps, they were woven into wreaths for barns and stables. In ancient Scandinavia, they were placed in the earth above graves to mark the border between the living and the ancestral realm.

The evergreen was not a symbol of festivity.  
It was a magical shield.

## The Witch’s Trinity: Pine, Fir & Juniper

### Pine: The Breath of the Winter Forest
Among witches, **pine** was revered for its scent—the sharp, resinous breath that cleared both the lungs and the unseen air.

Pine was burned:

- To drive out sickness  
- To break curses tied to winter  
- To protect travelers  
- To strengthen vitality in the cold season  

Folk healers boiled pine needles to make a tonic for chest ailments, believing it carried the breath of the green world itself.

The tree was a literal container of sun-fed vitality.

### Fir: The Silent Guardian
Fir trees, with their tall, unmoving posture, were connected to **watchfulness**.

Old forest witches believed fir trees were inhabited by “quiet spirits”—protective, solemn, non-human beings that observed without interfering unless called. Fir branches were used:

- In protective bundles  
- Under cradles to keep infants safe  
- In dream-sachets for prophetic winter sleep  

Fir wood was carved into small talismans, especially around the winter solstice, to guard against the Wild Hunt and other winter processions of the dead.

### Juniper: The Winter Exorcist
Juniper is the evergreen with teeth.

Its smoke cuts.  
Its scent drives.  
Its magic has edge.

Juniper branches were burned in almost every part of pre-Christian Europe during the harshest weeks of winter. The Balkan ritual of juniper fumigation—still alive in pockets of Montenegro, Serbia, and Croatia—has roots older than written history.

Witches used juniper smoke to:

- Clear illnesses  
- Drive out spirits  
- Protect newborns and animals  
- Purify tools  
- Renew household magic at the solstice  

Juniper is winter’s spear—sharp, purifying, direct.

## Evergreens as Threshold Magic

Before Christmas trees, before wreaths as decorations, evergreens were hung over doors and windows because **thresholds were the places spirits entered**.

Every pre-Christian witchcraft tradition in Europe acknowledged this.

In Old Norse houses, fir and pine boughs were laid across the top of door frames to confuse spirits who “counted leaves” and lost track of where the living dwelled.

In Slavic villages, juniper and pine were hung together to block the dead during the solstice—when “the doors between worlds stood loosely.”

In the Carpathians, evergreen branches were tucked into rafters to keep witches and nocturnal beings from slipping through cracks during the Twelve Nights of Winter.

And in the British Isles, holly (another evergreen) was brought inside not as decoration, but as a **barrier plant**—the thorned guardian.

Before Christians placed evergreens in churches, witches placed evergreens on thresholds.

## Evergreen Offerings for the Ancestors

Not all winter spirits were harmful.  
Some were beloved.

In many pagan European traditions, evergreen branches were laid on graves or cairns during the solstice as offerings of remembrance and life. The belief was simple:

**The evergreen carries the life-force the dead no longer have.**

It was not a gift of grief, but of vitality—an invitation for ancestral protection, dreams, and guidance during the dark season.

Witches often placed:

- Fir branches at family graves  
- Juniper berries at crossroads  
- Small pine cones on ancestral altars  
- Evergreen wreaths over hearths to call in protective ancestors  

This was the original “holiday wreath”—a magical loop of life offered to those who walked before.

## Evergreens as House Guardians: Spirits of the Green World

Before the Christmas tree became a cultural symbol, certain regions believed every evergreen had its own indwelling spirit—an entity that held the vitality of the tree through the barren months.

In old Baltic, Finnish, and some Slavic traditions, witches left offerings at the base of evergreen trees:

- Milk  
- Bread  
- Mead  
- A strand of hair  
- A coin  
- A pinch of herbs  

These offerings were not for gods—  
they were for the tree-spirit itself.

The belief was that the evergreen, because it stayed alive when other plants died back, could act as a guardian—watching over the homestead, influencing weather, and repelling harmful forces.

The Christmas tree is only the modern descendant of that much older practice.

## Winter Solstice Evergreens: The Original “Tree Magic”

It is no coincidence that evergreens became central to winter celebrations.  
The solstice was the pivot point between death and rebirth—  
and the evergreen was the most visible proof that life endured.

Witches used evergreens:

- To call back the sun  
- As protective bundles over beds  
- In divination about the coming year  
- As symbols in winter spells for strength and endurance  
- In cleansing fires lit at dawn after the longest night  

In the Balkans, evergreen twigs were carried to fountains and thrown into the water at sunrise to “awaken” the waters for spring.

In Scandinavia, fir resin was mixed with tallow to create protective candles only burned during solstice nights.

In the Celtic world, holly and ivy were twined together as a charm against misfortune.

Winter tree magic was everywhere because winter death was everywhere.  
The evergreen was the antidote.

## A Witch’s Ritual: Evergreen Spell for Winter Protection  
*An original working for Wild Witch Herbs*

This ritual draws from documented pagan customs but is constructed as a clean, modern spell rooted in Old European tradition.

### **You Need**
- A small branch of **pine or fir**  
- A few **juniper berries** or a pinch of dried juniper  
- A piece of natural cord or thread  
- A white or dark green candle  

### **The Work**

1. **Cleanse the space**  
   Light the candle. Touch the evergreen to your chest three times.

   Say:

   *“Life that stands through winter,  
   stand with me now.”*

2. **Bind the spell**  
   Wrap the cord around the evergreen, tying three knots.

   With each knot say:

   *“For protection.  
   For endurance.  
   For the bright return of the sun.”*

3. **Feed the charm**  
   Crush the juniper berries between your fingers and anoint the evergreen branch with them, letting the scent rise.

4. **Seal the working**  
   Hold the evergreen over the candle flame (not close enough to burn) and say:

   *“Through the longest night,  
   through the turning of the year,  
   stand guard at my threshold  
   and keep the shadows far.”*

5. **Hang it above your doorway**  
   This is the oldest way witches used winter evergreens: as threshold guardians.

Let it remain until the first signs of spring, when it can be buried respectfully in the earth.
