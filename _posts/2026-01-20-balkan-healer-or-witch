## Same Knowledge. Different Ending.

In Balkan history, **folk knowledge didn’t decide fate**.

Context did.

Here are two real women.

---

## Case One: The Village Healer (Unnamed, Common, Protected)

She:
- delivered babies
- treated wounds
- knew herbs
- spoke charms quietly
- lived embedded in her village

Her work was tolerated because:
- people needed her
- she framed knowledge as help
- failure could be forgiven

These women rarely left written records.  
But they were everywhere.

Their survival depended on **usefulness**.

---

## Case Two: Magda Logomer (Accused Witch, 1750s Croatia)

Magda Logomer was a peasant woman accused of witchcraft during Croatia’s peak persecution period.

She was:
- arrested
- tortured
- interrogated for causing harm

Her case only ended when **Empress Maria Theresa intervened**, questioning the legitimacy of witch trials.

Magda survived—but barely.

She became dangerous the moment blame attached to her.

---

## The Difference Was Never Herbs

Both women likely knew:
- medicinal plants
- harmful doses
- spoken charms
- protection rites

Only one lost protection.

Once a woman was framed as *causing harm*, the label “witch” followed naturally.

---

## Later Echo: Baba Anujka (1920s Serbia)

Centuries later, **Baba Anujka** was tried not as a witch—but as a poisoner.

Her crime?
Using folk knowledge with lethal consequences.

Magic didn’t disappear.  
It entered the courtroom.

## What These Cases Teach Us

In the Balkans:
- healers survived when trusted
- witches emerged when fear needed shape
- knowledge itself was never neutral

This pattern explains why Balkan witchcraft endured longer than elsewhere.
