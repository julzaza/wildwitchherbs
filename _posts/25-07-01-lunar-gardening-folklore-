Not every witch kept a grimoire. Most just kept a patch of dirt and knew when to dig.

The moon was their calendar. Their clock. Their reminder of when to slice roots or bury bones. They didn’t need Instagram posts about “new moon intentions.” They knew which nights were for seed, which were for sickle, and which were best left alone.

Before witchcraft became something you ordered in a box, it was tied to soil and sky. This post is about that kind of witchcraft.

## The Moon Tells the Roots When to Rise

Science will tell you the moon pulls water in the soil. It shifts moisture, swells sap, and stirs the tides in your blood. That’s enough for most. But witches don’t stop at logic.

They watch how plants lean toward moonlight. They track how dreams shift as seeds sprout. They whisper to the dirt during waning moons and slice nettles on full ones, so the sting stays potent.

This isn’t a trend. It’s survival wisdom.

## Moon Phases and What to Do

### 🌑 New Moon – The Void  
- No planting. Just planning.  
- Bless the soil. Light a candle. Rest.  
- In Balkan villages, women once laid their hands on bare ground during the dark moon, asking it to take grief or sickness before the new crop.

### 🌒 Waxing Moon – Rise and Grow  
- Plant herbs that grow above ground: **mugwort**, **motherwort**, **tulsi**, **chamomile**.  
- Good for charms, attraction spells, strength work.  
- In parts of India, seeds were soaked and whispered over during waxing moons — not prayer, but pact.

### 🌕 Full Moon – Height and Harvest  
- Harvest leafy plants and flowers.  
- Make tinctures, salves, or bundles for drying.  
- In rural Romania, full moon harvests were used for love spells — especially when picking verbena or yarrow from crossroads.

### 🌘 Waning Moon – Cut and Root  
- Time for pruning, uprooting, planting root crops.  
- Best for banishing, binding, endings.  
- In Caribbean Vodou, offerings were sometimes buried under herbs planted during the waning moon, tying intention into the roots.

## Planting Rituals Across Cultures

Witches didn’t plant just by phase. They planted with **offerings**, **spit**, **songs**, and **superstition** — all tied to the moon.

- **Andean farmers** spit on coca seeds before burying them — their breath sealed fate.  
- **Slavic midwives** wrapped wormwood seeds in linen and buried them before dawn, whispering names of ancestors to protect the garden.  
- In **Yoruba land**, offerings of honey and cowrie were buried before planting sacred herbs used in *Ifá* divination.  
- **Jewish mystics** aligned sowing with the Hebrew lunar calendar. In some Kabbalistic circles, prayers were recited before planting herbs associated with specific *sefirot* (cosmic attributes), such as sage for *Chokhmah* (wisdom) or hyssop for *Gevurah* (severity).

These rituals weren’t extras. They were the work.

## Moon Herbs with Meaning

Here are a few herbs tied to the moon — culturally and magically:

- **Artemisia (all kinds)** – Vision, clarity, protection. Burned on full moons or soaked under moonlight and added to baths in Balkan and Chinese traditions.  
- **Hyssop** – Purification. Used in Kabbalah and Christian rituals alike. “Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean.”  
- **Pennyroyal** – Female power and protection. Tied to old English midwives and also used by Greek priestesses of Hecate.  
- **Mugwort** – Dreamwork and divination. Used globally: in Slavic solstice rites, Japanese purification baths, and Native American smudges.  
- **Mandrake** – Dangerous magic. Said to cry when pulled. In Jewish folklore, it was used to conceive — not without risk.

## If You Don’t Have Land

Don’t let that stop you.

Lunar planting can happen in:

- A jar on your windowsill  
- A pot on a balcony  
- An abandoned patch of dirt near the train tracks

Magic doesn’t need permission. Just timing.

## You’re Not Gardening. You’re Remembering.

Every lunar planting is an act of memory — yours, your ancestors’, or the land’s.

So plant when the moon pulls, not when the market says it’s trendy.

That’s how witches do it.
