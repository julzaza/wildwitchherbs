Witchcraft doesn’t end at the altar — it continues in the dirt.

Long before apps and pretty planners told us when to sow seeds, people watched the moon. They didn’t do it for aesthetics. They did it because it worked.

Lunar gardening is practical magic. The moon affects ocean tides, animal behavior, even sleep. It affects plants too — especially the water in their cells, the direction of their growth, and the energy they hold when you cut or harvest them.

It’s not about following every rule to the letter. It’s about tuning in to something older than agriculture itself.

## Why Moon Phases Matter in the Garden

Every plant responds to light, water, and gravity — and the moon plays a role in all three. That’s not folklore, that’s physics.

- During the **waxing moon**, sap rises. Herbs grow upward. Energy moves toward stems and leaves.
- During the **waning moon**, the pull turns downward. Roots deepen. Energy consolidates.
- The **new moon** is for rest and setting intention.
- The **full moon** brings peak energy, clarity, and harvest.

It’s the difference between planting something that thrives and something that barely makes it.

## Phase-by-Phase Planting Guide for Witches

### New Moon — *Stillness and Preparation*  
- Don't plant — observe. Clean tools, plan spells, rest.  
- Soak seeds. Let them absorb silence before growth.  
- This is a powerful time for intention-setting, grounding, and blessing your garden space.

### Waxing Moon — *Growth and Expansion*  
- Plant leafy herbs: **basil**, **lemon balm**, **mugwort**, **mint**.  
- Feed the soil, speak to your plants, pour in vision.  
- Good time for charm bags, attraction work, fertility rituals.

### Full Moon — *Harvest and Power*  
- Harvest magical herbs now — they’re full of vitality.  
- Dry, charge, bless, or distill.  
- Perfect time for divination, making moon oils, or herbal baths.

### Waning Moon — *Release and Root*  
- Plant root crops: **valerian**, **ashwagandha**, **dandelion**.  
- Prune, banish, compost.  
- Bury offerings. Cleanse your space. Uproot what no longer serves.

## Cultural Practices and Lunar Gardening

Real witches don’t blindly follow calendars — they listen to land and lineage. Lunar gardening shows up in different forms across traditions:

- **Slavic farmers** marked lunar days with religious feasts and seasonal rituals.
- **West African traditions** often begin planting with an offering to land spirits under a specific moon.
- **Andean cultures** include personal acts like spitting on seeds or singing to them before planting, aligning soul with soil.
- In **Judaism**, certain seeds and grains were blessed or ritually separated before planting as part of sacred agricultural law.

These aren’t trends. They’re survival techniques passed down through cultures that understood timing meant everything.

## You Don’t Need a Field

Lunar planting isn’t reserved for people with land. If you’ve got:

- A windowsill with sun,  
- A single pot,  
- Or a patch of tired earth you can touch —  

You have enough.

Even small herbs grown with intention hold more power than a full bed planted mindlessly.

## Coming Soon: Moon-Raised Seeds

I’ll be offering *Artemisia annua* seeds grown and harvested with lunar cycles in mind — wild, potent, and untreated. Not mass-produced. Not lab-tamed. Just strong, real medicine raised the old way.

## Closing Words

You don’t need perfection. You need rhythm.  
Plant when the moon says yes.  
Harvest when the plants lean toward your hands.  
Rest when everything else does.

Witchcraft is remembering how to listen. The moon is still speaking.
