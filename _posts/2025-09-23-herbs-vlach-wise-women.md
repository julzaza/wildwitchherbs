The **Timok Valley** of Eastern Serbia is more than rolling vineyards and quiet rivers.  

It is a **living apothecary**, where Vlach wise women (*babe lečarke*) still gather herbs at dawn, reciting half-forgotten prayers in a language that drifts between Romanian and archaic Serbian.

Below are **seven key plants** recorded in ethnographic surveys and folk-medical manuals, each carrying layers of **magic and science**.

### 1. Yarrow (*Achillea millefolium*)
*Folklore:* Collected on **St. John’s Eve**, yarrow was hung above doors to **banish illness** and sprinkled in wedding bread to ensure fidelity.  

*Science:* Rich in flavonoids and sesquiterpene lactones, yarrow shows **anti-inflammatory** and **wound-healing** effects.

### 2. Rue (*Ruta graveolens*)
*Folklore:* Called **ruta** or “the witch’s herb,” it was worn in a small pouch to guard against the **evil eye**.  

*Science:* Contains rutin and essential oils with mild antimicrobial properties—supporting its reputation as a protective herb.

### 3. Mugwort (*Artemisia vulgaris*)
*Folklore:* Burned as a smudge to **summon dreams** or carried for safe travel across the Danube.  

*Science:* Modern research confirms **antimicrobial** and **mild sedative** actions.

### 4. Wormwood (*Artemisia absinthium*)
*Folklore:* Sprigs were placed on graves to guide souls, a practice echoing through Balkan vampire tales.  

*Science:* Bitter compounds like absinthin stimulate digestion and may have anti-parasitic activity.

### 5. St. John’s Wort (*Hypericum perforatum*)
*Folklore:* Gathered at midsummer, dipped in oil, and placed on windowsills for **solar protection**.  

*Science:* Well-studied for **mild to moderate depression** via hypericin and hyperforin.

### 6. Elder (*Sambucus nigra*)
*Folklore:* Considered a **gateway to the spirit world**. Cutting an elder tree without asking the spirit’s permission was taboo.  

*Science:* Elderberries are high in **antioxidant anthocyanins** and support immune function.

### 7. Wild Basil (*Ocimum sp.*)
*Folklore:* Used in **love charms** tied with red thread, as described in Vlach knot magic.  

*Science:* Essential oils with eugenol lend antibacterial and aromatic qualities.

#### Harvest Rites and Offerings
Healers always made an **offering—bread crumbs, coins, or a whispered prayer—before cutting the first plant**.  
This practice, villagers say, ensures the herb retains its “duša,” or soul.
