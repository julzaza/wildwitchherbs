## Menstruation Was Never Neutral

Across history, menstruation was not ignored.

It was **managed, contained, restricted, ritualized, feared, or revered**.

No traditional culture treated menstrual blood as biologically meaningless.

That alone should tell us something.

---

## Blood as a Boundary Substance

In folk cosmologies, blood marked:
- life and death  
- fertility and danger  
- creation and contamination  

Menstrual blood was especially powerful because it appeared **without injury**.

This made it anomalous — and therefore threatening to order.

---

## The Universal Fear: Threshold Women

A menstruating woman was often considered:
- neither fully fertile nor infertile  
- neither sick nor healthy  
- neither ritually clean nor impure  

Anthropologists call this **liminality**.

Folk cultures called it **dangerous**.

---

## Ancient Near East: Blood That Angered Gods

In Mesopotamian texts, menstrual blood was believed to:
- disrupt ritual efficacy  
- anger household spirits  
- weaken protective charms  

Women were temporarily excluded from temple spaces not because they were “dirty,” but because their blood **overrode ritual control**.

---

## Hindu Traditions: Shakti Without Containment

In many Indian folk systems, menstruating women were separated not out of disgust, but because their **Shakti (power)** was believed to be volatile.

Menstrual huts functioned as:
- rest spaces  
- containment zones  
- spiritual firebreaks  

Importantly: menstruating women were often excused from labor.

## Indigenous North America: Blood as Spirit Language

Among several Plains and Southwestern tribes:
- menstrual blood attracted spirits
- isolation protected both the woman *and* the community

Some women used this time for:
- dreaming
- divination
- instruction from elders

Menstruation was a **visionary state**, not a weakness.

## Africa: Menstrual Power and Agricultural Fear

In parts of West and Central Africa:
- menstruating women were barred from crops
- menstrual blood was believed to disrupt growth cycles

This was not moral judgment — it was **cosmic interference theory**.

---

## Japan: Kegare and Sacred Disruption

In Shinto belief, menstruation caused *kegare* — ritual disruption.

But:
- disruption ≠ sin  
- disruption ≠ shame  

It meant **ritual incompatibility**, not moral failure.

---

## Europe: Witches, Weather, and Blood Fear

Medieval European folklore attributed to menstruating women the power to:
- spoil wine
- blight crops
- dull knives
- call storms

This fear later merged with witchcraft accusations.

Not because women were weak.

Because they were **uncontained**.

---

## Why Taboos Were Not Arbitrary

Across cultures, menstrual taboos appear where societies feared:
- spiritual leakage
- uncontrolled fertility
- disruption of male ritual authority
- ancestral anger

Taboos were **containment strategies**, not hygiene advice.

---

## What Modern Culture Lost

Modern narratives frame taboos as:
- ignorance
- misogyny
- superstition

Sometimes that is true.

But often, taboos reflect an older truth:
> Power requires boundaries.

---

## Why This Still Matters

When menstruation is framed as:
- an inconvenience  
- a disorder  
- a productivity problem  

We repeat the same mistake — just with better language.

Folk cultures feared menstrual blood.

Modern culture **medicalizes it**.

Neither is neutral.
