## Unlocking the Secrets of the Nine Healing Herbs

The **Nine Herbs Charm**—also called **Nigon Wyrta Galdor** or the **Nine Wort Spell**—is one of the most extraordinary examples of **Old English magic**. Written in the **10th century AD** in the **Lacnunga**, a collection of Anglo-Saxon medical texts preserved in **British Library Harley MS 585**, it combines **herbal wisdom, mythology, and ritual power**.

This charm demonstrates how early Anglo-Saxons viewed **plants as sacred allies**, numbers as magic, and spoken words as transformative forces.

## Woden and the Sacred Numbers

A unique feature is its invocation of **Woden**, making it one of only **two mentions of this god in Old English poetry** (the other in *Maxims I*).  

Robert K. Gordon’s translation reads:

> “A snake came crawling, it bit a man.  
> Then Woden took **nine glory-twigs**,  
> Smote the serpent so that it flew into nine parts.  
> There apple brought this pass against poison,  
> That she nevermore would enter her house.”

Here, **Woden strikes the serpent with nine twigs**, possibly inscribed with **runes representing the first letters of each herb**, linking divine power directly to the plants. The repeated use of **three and nine**, sacred in **Germanic paganism**, amplifies the **magical potency** of the ritual.
