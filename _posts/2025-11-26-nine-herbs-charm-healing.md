## Nine Herbs Charm: Ancient Anglo-Saxon Healing Magic

The **Nine Herbs Charm**—also known as **Nigon Wyrta Galdor**, the **Lay of the Nine Healing Herbs**, or the **Nine Wort Spell**—is one of the most extraordinary examples of **Old English magic**. Recorded in the **10th century AD** in the **Lacnunga**, a collection of Anglo-Saxon medical texts preserved in **British Library Harley MS 585**, it combines **herbal knowledge, mythology, and ritual power**.  

This charm demonstrates how early Anglo-Saxons viewed **plants as sacred allies**, numbers as magic, and spoken words as transformative forces.

## Woden and the Sacred Numbers

A unique feature of the charm is its reference to **Woden**, making it one of only **two mentions of this god in Old English poetry** (the other is in *Maxims I*).  

Robert K. Gordon’s translation reads:

> “A snake came crawling, it bit a man.  
> Then Woden took **nine glory-twigs**,  
> Smote the serpent so that it flew into nine parts.  
> There apple brought this pass against poison,  
> That she nevermore would enter her house.”

Here, **Woden strikes the serpent with nine twigs**, possibly inscribed with **runes representing the first letters of each herb**, linking divine power to the plants. The repeated use of **three and nine**, sacred in **Germanic paganism**, amplifies the **magical potency of the ritual**.

## The Nine Healing Herbs and Their Magical Significance

The herbs are typically considered:

- **Mugwort:** Protection, dreams, spiritual awareness  
- **Plantain:** Wounds, inflammation, grounding energy  
- **Lamb's Cress:** Purification, digestive aid, cleansing energy  
- **Betony:** Headaches, mental clarity, warding spirits  
- **Chamomile:** Calm, relaxation, peace, anti-inflammatory  
- **Crab-Apple:** Cleansing, purification, ritual offerings  
- **Nettle:** Strength, protection, purification  
- **Fennel:** Digestive support, courage, clarity  
- **Garlic:** Antimicrobial, protection, warding negative energy  

Reciting the charm aloud transforms these herbs into a **ritual of healing and spiritual empowerment**, demonstrating the inseparability of **nature, magic, and intention**.

## Pagan Origins & Christian Adaptation

Though later **Christianized**, the charm retains its **pre-Christian energy**, emphasizing the **timeless human desire** to connect with plants, ritual, and divine power. Its survival reflects the **enduring practicality and symbolism** of herbal magic.

## Modern Applications

The Nine Herbs Charm can inspire **today’s herbalists and witches**:

- **Sacred Herb Rituals:** Use each herb intentionally for healing, protection, or spiritual work.  
- **Magical Numbers:** Incorporate **three and nine** in spellwork to echo ancient potency.
