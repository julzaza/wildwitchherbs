The **Nine Herbs Charm**, also known as **Nigon Wyrta Galdor** or the **Nine Wort Spell**, is a 10th-century Anglo-Saxon magical text preserved in the **Lacnunga manuscript** (Harley MS 585). 

This spell combines **herbal wisdom, ritual chanting, and divine invocation** to provide protection, healing, and magical empowerment.  

It is one of the **few surviving examples of Old English pagan herbal magic**, blending practical herbal knowledge with spiritual and mystical traditions.

## Woden, Sacred Numbers, and Magical Power

The charm uniquely invokes **Woden**, making it one of only **two mentions of this god in Old English poetry**. Robert K. Gordon translates:

> “A snake came crawling, it bit a man.  
> Then Woden took **nine glory-twigs**,  
> Smote the serpent so that it flew into nine parts.  
> There apple brought this pass against poison,  
> That she nevermore would enter her house.”

The nine twigs may have been **marked with runes** representing each of the **nine sacred herbs**, linking divine authority to plant power. The repeated use of **three and nine** reflects the **sacred Germanic numerology**, amplifying ritual potency.

Protective plant power was not limited to spoken charms. In wider European folklore, living guardians such as rowan trees were planted at thresholds to repel harm, functioning as physical counterparts to spoken herbal defenses — a tradition explored in **[Rowan Trees by the Door](/rowan-trees-front-door-old-world-folklore/)**.

Each herb carries **symbolic, medicinal, and magical significance**, and chanting the charm aloud transforms ordinary herbal preparations into **powerful protective and healing rituals**. 

This tradition is echoed across many European plant rites, as explored in **[Top Protective Herbs in Witchcraft](/top-protective-herbs-witchcraft/)**, where sacred plants stand as guardians against harm, illness, and unseen intrusion.

## Ritual Preparation of the Nine Herbs

In traditional practice, the nine sacred herbs were not merely gathered but ritually unified. Each plant was crushed together in a mortar, reducing leaf, seed, and root into a single living compound. This act symbolized the binding of their individual spirits into one protective force. 

The Old English text in the Lacnunga instructs that the **mixture be combined with apple pulp and ash bark**, substances associated with purification and resilience. The mash could then be prepared as a healing salve for wounds, infections, or venom, or steeped into a potent herbal drink for internal protection.

During the grinding, the practitioner **recited the charm aloud, invoking divine authority—often calling upon Woden** — while rhythmically working the herbs. 

Breath, voice, and motion fused intention into the medicine. In this way, remedy and spell became inseparable: plant power awakened through word, ritual action, and sacred preparation.

## Pagan Origins and Christian Adaptation

The charm preserves **pre-Christian magical practices**, later adapted to fit early Christian norms. 

Despite adaptation, it retains **raw mystical energy**, highlighting the human desire to connect with **plants, ritual, and divine power**.  

It provides insight into how **early Anglo-Saxons blended observation, herbal knowledge, and ritual** for survival and spiritual protection.

## Modern Applications for Herbalists and Witches

The Nine Herbs Charm can inspire **contemporary herbalists and ritual practitioners**:

- **Sacred Herbal Rituals:** Work intentionally with each of the nine herbs for healing, protection, or spiritual empowerment.

- **Chanting and Intention:** Recite or write the charm to activate herbal power.
