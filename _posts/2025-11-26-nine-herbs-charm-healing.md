## Ancient Anglo-Saxon Healing Spell

The **Nine Herbs Charm**, also known as **Nigon Wyrta Galdor** or the **Nine Wort Spell**, is a 10th-century **Anglo-Saxon magical text** preserved in the **Lacnunga manuscript (Harley MS 585)**. This spell combines **herbal wisdom, ritual chanting, and divine invocation** to provide **protection, healing, and magical empowerment**.  

It is one of the **few surviving examples of Old English pagan herbal magic**, blending practical herbal knowledge with **spiritual and mystical traditions**.

## Woden, Sacred Numbers, and Magical Power

The charm uniquely invokes **Woden**, making it one of only **two mentions of this god in Old English poetry**. Robert K. Gordon translates:

> “A snake came crawling, it bit a man.  
> Then Woden took **nine glory-twigs**,  
> Smote the serpent so that it flew into nine parts.  
> There apple brought this pass against poison,  
> That she nevermore would enter her house.”

The nine twigs may have been **marked with runes** representing each of the **nine sacred herbs**, linking divine authority to plant power. The repeated use of **three and nine** reflects the **sacred Germanic numerology**, amplifying ritual potency.
