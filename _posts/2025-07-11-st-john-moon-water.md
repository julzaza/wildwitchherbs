## Moon Water with St. John's Wort: Gentle Light in Times of Sorrow

Though known for its bright, sunny energy, **St. John’s Wort also carries a shadow magic**—a calming balm for the spirit, a boundary between worlds, and a guardian during emotional storms. When steeped in moonlight, this powerful herb helps us **mourn, release, and reconnect**.

In **folk medicine**, St. John's Wort was used not only to lift spirits, but to **protect the soul from wandering or breaking apart** in times of sorrow. It was burned to drive away spirits of madness and grief. Hung over sickbeds or graves, it was believed to safeguard the soul’s journey between the worlds.

## Spell: Water for the Wandering Soul

“With petals bright and moonlight deep,  
I call the ones I’ve lost in sleep.  
Guard my heart, and light the way—  
Grief shall soften, but love shall stay.”

Whisper this over the jar when placing it beneath the moon.

## Folklore Footnotes

St. John’s Wort blooms on the edge of **summer and the Otherworld**. Folk belief says it shines with **solar power by day**, but carries **spirit magic by night**. In Eastern European rituals, it was burned at gravesides or steeped in oil for protection from wandering souls.

Its yellow flowers were thought to bleed red when crushed—symbolizing **wounds of the heart** and the soul’s journey through pain and healing.

**Grieving is a process and it takes time. Take your time and use this moon water to light a lantern through sorrow and loss, not to banish it—but to walk with it, gently.**
