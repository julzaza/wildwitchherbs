## When Strength Became a Liability

In Balkan villages, women who **carried households, birthed children, healed the sick, or mediated conflicts** were highly visible—and visibility carried risk.

Folklore consistently observed that:
- envy and jealousy could **weaken vitality**  
- unresolved conflict invited misfortune  
- household imbalance could **spill into personal health**  

Protective herbs were not superstition—they were practical **tools for maintaining continuity**.

## Protection as Maintenance, Not Ceremony

Protective herb use was subtle and functional:
- a **sprig over a doorway**  
- a **clove in a pocket**  
- **smoke after illness**  
- a **leaf carried during hardship**  

These rituals were part of daily survival, not spectacle.

## Core Protective Herbs in Balkan Folklore

### Rue (*Ruta graveolens*)

Rue was widely documented in Balkan ethnography (Pócs, Vukanović) as protection against **envy, gossip, and sudden misfortune**.  

- Carried briefly after childbirth  
- Hung near beds or thresholds  
- Respected for potency; not used casually  

### Garlic (*Allium sativum*)

Balkan women believed garlic protected **blood, life-force, and household balance**.  

- Worn postpartum or during illness  
- Placed in corners or carried when traveling  
- Repelled ill will and spiritual predators  

### Juniper (*Juniperus communis*)
**Region:** Balkans, Dinaric Alps  

Smoke from juniper was used after:

- periods of emotional or social upheaval  

Women performed this themselves to **restore household harmony**.

### Bay Laurel (*Laurus nobilis*)

Mugwort was protective at **thresholds of vulnerability**: sleep, travel, and menstruation.
