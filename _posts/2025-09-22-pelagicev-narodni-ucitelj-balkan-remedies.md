## Folk Remedies

### 1. Fatigue and Weakness
> “First, by moving around in pleasant company and doing light work, one should remove thoughts that bring sadness and grief; walking or otherwise getting fresh air is helpful; and to forget one’s worry, deep whistling may change one’s state of mind. Eat kačamak, soft boiled eggs, fresh and dried fruit, and sauces made of raw onion and raw radish.”

**Modern twist:** Nettle tea, rosemary infusions, or a warming yarrow porridge echo Pelagić’s idea of using wholesome foods and herbs to restore strength.

### 2. Cold and Flu Prevention
> “Whoever washes and rubs his chest with cold water and ensures that he never sweats in the room will not catch a cold. And whoever does catch a cold, let him immediately take an ax and split wood until he is drenched with sweat over his whole body.”

**Modern herbal addition:** Pelagić emphasizes the body’s circulation; today, warming teas with elderflower, thyme, or sage can complement movement and fresh air for cold prevention.

### 3. Digestive Health
Pelagić frequently recommends **raw or lightly cooked vegetables** like onions, radishes, and leafy greens, along with fermented dairy or kačamak. These are used to:

* Stimulate digestion
* Prevent bloating or sluggishness
* Support overall vitality

**Herbal parallel:** Caraway, fennel, and mint teas for digestion echo the same principle.

### 4. Plant-Based Remedies
While Pelagić provides dozens of plant recommendations, English sources highlight:

* **Nettle:** Strengthens hair and nails, purifies the blood  
* **Yarrow:** For minor wounds, cleansing, and as a gentle tonic  
* **Chamomile:** Soothing for the stomach, gentle anti-inflammatory  
* **Rosemary:** Circulation, mental clarity, hair tonic  

He often combines **diet and herbs**, not relying on a single remedy.
