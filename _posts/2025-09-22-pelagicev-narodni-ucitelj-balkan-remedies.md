Vasa Pelagić’s *Narodni Učitelj* is far more than a 19th-century manual on literacy and morality—it is a treasure trove of **folk remedies, herbal lore, and practical wellness guidance** from rural Balkan life. Beyond ethical instruction, Pelagić recorded dozens of remedies, herbal preparations, and food-based tonics—**wisdom still resonant for modern herbalists and witches seeking ancestral inspiration**.

## Folk Remedies for Fatigue and Weakness
> “First, by moving around in pleasant company and doing light work, one should remove thoughts that bring sadness and grief; walking or otherwise getting fresh air is helpful; and to forget one’s worry, deep whistling may change one’s state of mind. Eat kačamak, soft boiled eggs, fresh and dried fruit, and sauces made of raw onion and raw radish.”

Pelagić understood the interplay of **mind, movement, and nourishment**. Today, nettle tea, rosemary infusions, or a warming yarrow porridge echo the same principle: **herbs and wholesome foods restore vitality naturally**.

## Traditional Cold and Flu Prevention with Balkan Herbs
> “Whoever washes and rubs his chest with cold water and ensures that he never sweats in the room will not catch a cold. And whoever does catch a cold, let him immediately take an ax and split wood until he is drenched with sweat over his whole body.”

Pelagić emphasized **circulation, fresh air, and active living**. Herbal complements—elderflower, thyme, sage, and warming teas—work alongside lifestyle practices to fortify the body against seasonal illnesses.

## Digestive Health: Plant-Based and Folk Approaches
Raw or lightly cooked vegetables—onions, radishes, leafy greens—alongside fermented dairy or kačamak appear repeatedly in Pelagić’s guidance. They are used to:

- Stimulate digestion  
- Prevent bloating or sluggishness  
- Support overall vitality

**Herbal parallels:** Caraway, fennel, and mint teas honor the same principle, blending tradition with practical herbalism.

## Key Plant-Based Remedies
Pelagić’s herbal repertoire emphasizes **holistic approaches rather than single remedies**. Key plants include:

- **Nettle:** Strengthens hair and nails, purifies the blood  
- **Yarrow:** Minor wounds, cleansing, gentle tonic  
- **Chamomile:** Soothing for the stomach, anti-inflammatory  
- **Rosemary:** Circulation, mental clarity, hair tonic  

These plants frequently appear **in combination with diet and daily routines**, illustrating a truly integrative herbal philosophy.

## Household and Hygiene Practices for Wellbeing
Pelagić prioritized preventive measures alongside herbs:

- Regular washing with clean water  
- Proper ventilation for living spaces  
- Sunlight exposure for people and stored foods  
- Emphasis on lifestyle-based disease prevention rather than relying solely on medicine

These practices reveal **an early understanding of environmental health and preventive care**, rooted in observation and folk knowledge.

## Why Pelagić’s Remedies Still Matter
Many of Pelagić’s favorite herbs—nettles, chamomile, mugwort—remain staples in **modern witchy apothecaries**. His combination of **folk wisdom, herbal knowledge, and practical life advice** continues to inspire herbalists exploring ancestral traditions.
