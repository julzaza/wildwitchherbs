## Herbs for Perimenopause & Menopause: Folklore of the Threshold

Menopause was never invisible.

Across cultures, when bleeding ceased, **attention sharpened**. A woman crossed from blood-governed life into **boundary authority**. She was no longer defined by reproduction — and that made her powerful, unsettling, or both.

This post examines herbs traditionally associated with **perimenopause and menopause**, grounded in folklore rather than modern hormone narratives.

## Menopause as a Social Threshold

What changed was not just the body, but the **social role**.

Across Europe, the Balkans, Central Asia, and Indigenous cultures:
- post-menstrual women were freed from fertility obligations
- sexual autonomy increased
- ritual authority expanded
- suspicion sometimes followed

This ambiguity shaped herbal use.

## Core Herbal Themes of Menopause

### 1. Heat and Dryness
Early European medicine described post-bleeding women as “hotter” and “drier.” This influenced plant choices.

Common responses:
- **Cooling nervines**
- **Moistening tonics**
- **Sleep-supporting herbs**

Examples:
- **Linden (*Tilia spp.*)** — Europe  
- **Lemon balm (*Melissa officinalis*)** — Mediterranean  
- **Mulungu (*Erythrina mulungu*)** — Brazil  

---

### 2. The Rise of Bitter Herbs
Bitterness marks transition.

Across cultures, bitter plants were introduced after bleeding ceased:
- **Gentian** — Europe  
- **Wormwood (*Artemisia absinthium*)** — Balkans, Central Europe  
- **Neem** — South Asia  

Bitters were believed to:
- sharpen perception
- protect boundaries
- prevent stagnation

---

### 3. Nervous System Protection
Sleep disturbances and agitation were recognized long before modern labels.

Herbs used included:
- **Hops** — Europe  
- **Valerian** — Eurasia  
- **Passionflower** — Americas  

These were not used daily forever, but **during crossing periods**.

## Balkan & Slavic Traditions

In Balkan folklore, post-menstrual women:
- prepared protection charms
- worked with wormwood and garlic
- oversaw death rites and household thresholds

Menopause did not end a woman’s role — it **changed its direction**.

---

## The Witch Hunt Context (Brief, Accurate)

Post-reproductive women were overrepresented in witch accusations — **not because menopause was feared**, but because:
- widowhood increased vulnerability
- economic independence threatened order
- lack of male protection mattered

Menopause correlated with risk, but **did not cause it**.

## What Menopause Was NOT

- Not a disease  
- Not a deficiency  
- Not a disappearance  

It was a **reassignment**.
