# How to Plant by the Moon  
**Real Witchy Lunar Gardening**

This isnâ€™t your grandmotherâ€™s Farmerâ€™s Almanac. Or maybe it is â€” if your grandmother tracked the moon, whispered to seeds, and timed everything to move with the sky.

Planting by the moon isnâ€™t some new-age fantasy. Itâ€™s old magic. The kind that shows up in ancient farming tablets, Slavic calendars, and whispered spells passed through dirty fingernails and dark kitchens. Itâ€™s practical. And it works.

Letâ€™s strip away the fluff and get into how real witches and old-world farmers actually used lunar cycles to grow their gardens.

## Why Plant by the Moon?

Lunar gardening isn't astrology â€” it's ancestral science. Moisture levels in the soil rise and fall with the moon, just like tides. Roots respond. Leaves swell. Saps shift.

Across cultures, people knew when to plant â€” not because a book told them to, but because their bones did. They watched. They listened.

## The Four Phases and What to Plant

### ðŸŒ‘ **New Moon to First Quarter (Waxing Crescent)**  
Energy moves upward.  
**Plant:** Leafy greens, lettuce, herbs that grow above ground fast.  
**Magical Use:** Good for spells of growth, healing, attracting.

### ðŸŒ“ **First Quarter to Full Moon (Waxing Gibbous)**  
The moon pulls strongest now.  
**Plant:** Fruits, beans, tomatoes, anything that bears above ground.  
**Magical Use:** Ideal for charm-making, manifestation, love work.

### ðŸŒ• **Full Moon to Last Quarter (Waning Gibbous)**  
Energy begins to settle.  
**Plant:** Root crops â€” carrots, garlic, beets.  
**Magical Use:** Time for divination, clarity, binding.

### ðŸŒ— **Last Quarter to New Moon (Waning Crescent)**  
Time for rest, pulling back.  
**Do Not Plant.** Instead: compost, weed, harvest.  
**Magical Use:** Banishing, releasing, death work.

## Rituals and Folklore from the Dirt

These arenâ€™t aesthetic moonwater TikTok moments. These are rituals born of survival.

- **Slavic Folk Calendars** marked planting dates using saintsâ€™ feast days, overlaid on pre-Christian moon rhythms.  
- **Ukrainian grandmothers** swore by planting root crops only on waning moons, and never with a full belly â€” hunger bound the gardener to the seed.  
- **Andean farmers** would spit on seeds before planting. Their breath â€” their spirit â€” passed to the plant.  
- **Old Balkan witches** washed seeds in moon-charged spring water before planting, then buried an egg or coin beneath the soil to feed the earth spirits.  
- **Nordic settlers** offered beer or blood to the land before sowing, asking permission. Some still do.

## Tools or Toys?

Youâ€™ll hear about biodynamic planting calendars. Some are legit, especially those rooted in *Maria Thunâ€™s* work in Europe. But remember â€” your ancestors didnâ€™t have printouts. They had moonlight, bare hands, and silence.

Try this:
- Watch the moon for one full cycle.
- Plant a few seeds on each phase.
- Keep notes.  
Your own dirt is wiser than someone elseâ€™s book.

## Planting Is Magic. Make It a Spell.

Ritual doesnâ€™t mean complicated.

- **Soak your seeds** in rainwater or river water under the waxing moon.  
- **Whisper** your intentions as you plant â€” not a prayer, but a contract.  
- **Tie a thread** around your wrist or seedling â€” something to connect your body to the green.  
- **Harvest in silence** when possible. Some traditions say the plants speak clearest then.

## Youâ€™re Not Just Growing Plants

Youâ€™re growing timing. Rhythm. A relationship with change.

When you plant by the moon, youâ€™re not just a gardener. Youâ€™re part of something older. You learn patience. You learn when to act â€” and when to wait.

And that, more than any flower, is what makes you a witch.
