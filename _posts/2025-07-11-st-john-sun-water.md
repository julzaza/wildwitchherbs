## It's Golden Light for Heavy Days

**St. John’s Wort (*Hypericum perforatum*) is the herb of the sun.** It bursts into yellow bloom at the height of summer, near the **summer solstice** or **St. John’s Day (June 24)**—a time long considered powerful for harvesting herbs and making magical preparations.

For centuries, people across Europe believed this herb could ward off evil spirits, chase away sadness, and light up the shadowed corners of the heart. In Slavic, Celtic, and Germanic traditions, it was hung above doors, worn in crowns, and even used to divine love or detect witchcraft.

Making **sun water** with St. John’s Wort brings together the brightest forces in nature—solar power, midsummer energy, and the herb’s mood-lifting, protective magic.

## Folklore Flash

In folk tradition, St. John’s Wort was called the “Chase-Devil” or “Woundwort.” Soldiers carried it into battle, and healers used it to treat both physical and spiritual wounds. It was believed to hold the **power of the midsummer sun**, banishing evil spirits, nightmares, and melancholy.

In Cornwall, it was even said that hanging it in the window would prevent thunder and lightning from striking the house.

## Caution

- This water is for **external or ritual use only** unless you're working with food-safe, properly identified herbs.
- St. John’s Wort can cause **sun sensitivity** when taken internally. Be cautious when handling fresh flowers in strong sunlight.

---

## Make St. John's Wort Sun Water Safe for Drinking:

- use spring water, rainwater that you’re sure is clean, or boiled/cooled water

- only speak or chant your intention, rather than placing inked paper or talismans inside

- use edible, food-safe St. John’s Wort (in small amounts)

- use glass jars, not metal or plastic which could leach under sunlight

- strain the herb out immediately after infusion to avoid bacterial growth

---

## Caution with St. John’s Wort:
- St. John’s Wort can interact with medications, increase sun sensitivity, and affect mood or liver enzymes.

- Small amounts (like one or two fresh blossoms steeped for a few hours) in a tea or water infusion are usually safe for most healthy adults, but it’s always good to check with an herbalist or doctor.

- Avoid drinking sun-exposed water that’s been left out too long (over 6–8 hours), especially in hot climates.
