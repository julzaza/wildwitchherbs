## Blood and Soil: The Old Magic of Menstrual Offerings

Long before shame was stitched to the hem of a woman’s skirt, menstrual blood was seen as sacred—**a gift, not a curse**. Across time and cultures, women bled in rhythm with the moon, and their blood was recognized not as waste, but as **life-force**—capable of nourishing both land and lineage.

In the old ways, it was said that **to give your blood to the soil was to speak directly to the Earth**.

### A Ritual Older Than Religion

Among **pre-Christian Slavs**, the act of returning menstrual blood to the ground was both **an offering and a bond**. A woman might squat in a garden’s corner, whispering her hopes for children, a good harvest, or healing. Her blood, rich with iron and intent, would soak into the roots. **No need for words—the soil understood.**

In **Irish and Scottish folk belief**, a woman bleeding in sync with the moon was said to possess "silver sight"—**a second sight**—and her blood, when placed at the base of sacred trees or stone circles, was believed to **call forth ancestors or fae**.

Some **Balkan mountain villages** held quiet traditions where women would anoint the edges of fields with blood-stained linen—**a charm to awaken the Earth’s fertility** before planting seeds.

In parts of **West Africa**, menstrual blood was mixed with red clay to mark shrines and fertility symbols, connecting womb and world in visible prayer.

*“A bleeding woman feeds both worlds—this one and the one yet to come.”* — Old Croatian saying

## Why Offer Blood to the Earth?

Modern witchcraft has reclaimed this ritual as **remembrance**. Returning blood to the soil serves as a spell for:

- **Fertility** (of body, land, ideas, and relationships)  
- **Healing** after miscarriage, grief, or trauma  
- **Reconnection** with nature and your own cyclical power  
- **Protection** and energetic grounding  
- **Ancestral communication**, especially with women of your bloodline

It’s also scientifically sound—**menstrual blood is rich in nitrogen, phosphorus, and stem cells**. Some witches feed their roses or mugwort with it. What once was taboo now becomes **communion.**

## A Simple Menstrual Earth Ritual

Perform this during the **New Moon** or the first day of your bleed.

### Steps:
- **Approach the soil with intention.** Take three deep breaths and feel your feet root into the Earth.
- Pour from a cup or just squat and release a few drops of blood into the soil. You may speak this charm aloud or silently:

*“Blood of my body, gift of my womb,  
To Earth I return, to life I attune.  
Seed and spirit, root and bone,  
By blood, I call my power home.”*

- Cover the offering gently with soil. Sit quietly and feel the exchange—**what leaves you also nourishes you.**

## Things to Keep in Mind

- **Safety:** Don’t leave blood where others might come into contact without consent. Use intention and respect.
- **Privacy:** This is a sacred act, not a spectacle. Do it for yourself, not for show.
- **Alternatives:** If collecting blood is difficult or you are no longer menstruating, you can bury a red-stained cloth or even **visualize the ritual** as a form of energy offering.

## The Return of Sacred Cycles

In a world obsessed with productivity and sterility, bleeding becomes a **radical act of remembering**. Giving your blood to the soil revives a forgotten truth: **you are not separate from nature—you are nature.**

The witches of old knew this. The land remembers.  
And when you return your blood to the earth, **so will you.**

*May your roots grow deep, and your womb magic return to its rightful throne.*
