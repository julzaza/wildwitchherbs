Fertility magic is one of the oldest forms of witchcraft, pulsing with ancestral memory and **the wild rhythm of the Earth herself**. 

Long before modern medicine or pharmaceutical interventions, women turned to herbs, moon cycles, and blood rites to encourage conception, honor the womb, and commune with the spirit of life itself.

One of the most potent, sacred rituals in this tradition is the act of **offering menstrual blood to the Earth**—a practice observed in cultures across the globe, from ancient Slavs to indigenous tribes and modern-day witches reclaiming body sovereignty.

## ✧ Menstrual Blood as Fertile Offering

In folk magic, menstrual blood is more than just physical—it is **life-force made visible**, a blend of death and potential, rich with symbolic and literal fertility. It has been used:

- To anoint seeds before planting
- To bless trees and sacred stones
- To mark the thresholds of homes or birthing spaces
- And, most often, **to feed the Earth directly**—returned with prayer, intention, and reverence.

Allowing a few drops of your blood to fall onto the soil, especially in your garden or under a chosen tree, is seen as an offering of partnership—**a pact between your body and the land**.

But when is the right time to do such a ritual?

## ✧ The White Moon and Red Moon Cycles

Folk wisdom once held that menstruation naturally aligned with the lunar cycle. While modern life has disrupted this harmony for many, some still notice synchronicities between their cycle and the moon.

There are two archetypal patterns:

### • The White Moon Cycle:
This is when menstruation occurs around the **New Moon** and ovulation around the **Full Moon**. It symbolizes **fertility, motherhood, introspection, and renewal**. Women on this cycle are traditionally seen as nurturing and turned inward, their blood a quiet prayer of renewal.

Rituals involving **menstrual offerings, fertility spells, or planting seeds of intention** were often performed during the **New Moon** in this pattern.

### • The Red Moon Cycle:
This is when menstruation occurs during the **Full Moon**, often associated with **wild women, healers, priestesses, and witches**. It represents **creativity, transformation, and inner power** rather than physical fertility.

Women on the Red Moon path may use their bleeding time for **shadow work, magical development, and spiritual fertility**—birthing ideas, art, or visions.

  *Whether you bleed with the White or Red Moon, your ritual is valid, powerful, and sacred.*

## ✧ What If You’re Not Bleeding During the New Moon?

No need to wait.

If your cycle doesn’t align with the New Moon—or if you no longer bleed—you can still perform the ritual meaningfully by:

- **Collecting your blood** during your cycle and storing it until the New Moon
- **Using symbolic offerings** like red wine, beet juice, or sacred herbs (e.g., mugwort, yarrow)
- **Performing an energetic ritual** through visualization, prayer, or song
- Honoring your **energetic womb space**, even if it no longer bleeds

The key is **intention**, not timing. The blood carries meaning because *you give it meaning*.

## ✧ A Simple Blood Offering Fertility Ritual

You’ll need:
- A quiet outdoor space (your garden, a forest, or a potted plant)
- Your menstrual blood (fresh or saved), or a symbolic substitute
- A small bowl of water and a sprig of rosemary or raspberry leaf

**Ritual Steps:**
1. Wait until the New Moon *or* the night you bleed—whichever feels most aligned.
2. Cast a circle if you like, or simply breathe deeply and call your ancestors, womb spirits, or the Earth herself.
3. Pour your blood onto the soil with these or your own words:

*“From my body to the Earth, from my blood to the roots.  
  I return this life-force to feed what will grow.  
  Fertility within me, around me, and beyond me—  
  As above, so below. So mote it be.”*

4. Dip your fingers in the water and anoint your lower belly or feet. Let the rosemary brush over your skin.
5. Sit in silence, or sing to the Earth if you feel moved.

## ✧ Final Thoughts

The ritual of offering menstrual blood to the Earth is not a relic—it’s a remembered way of living in **intimate rhythm with nature**. It speaks to the **sacred ecology** of body and soil, womb and seed.

Whether your desire is for a child, a creative harvest, or deeper spiritual connection, this practice honors the womb’s wisdom and the ancient magic in your blood.

Let the Earth receive what you no longer need. Let her feed you in return.
