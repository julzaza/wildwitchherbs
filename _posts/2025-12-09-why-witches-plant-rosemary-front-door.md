In the warm, wind-swept regions of the Mediterranean, rosemary grew as naturally as superstition.  
Villagers planted it near doors, gates, and paths for hundreds of years—not just for cooking, but to **guard the home**, **bless the family**, and **test visitors’ intentions**.

This custom survived into witchcraft, cunning work, and folk magical traditions from Italy to the Balkans, Spain to Greece, and into the British Isles through Mediterranean influence.

## Rosemary as the Scented Sentinel  
Folklore across Italy, Dalmatia, Greece, and southern France describes rosemary as the herb that:

- cleared stagnant energy  
- strengthened psychic sight  
- revealed hidden motives  
- purified those who crossed the threshold  

The scent itself was considered cleansing.

Housewives burned rosemary wood in the hearth, and cunning women brushed rosemary bundles over doorframes during liminal festivals.

## The Plant of Memory, Spirit, and the Dead  
In both classical and medieval tradition, rosemary is tied to **memory**:

- remembering the self  
- remembering one’s purpose  
- remembering the ancestors  

Doorways were spiritually dangerous places because the dead were believed to wander through them at night. Rosemary helped the living remember themselves—and kept the dead from following them inside.

Its evergreen nature symbolized:

- vigilance  
- purity  
- the eternal household flame

## Rosemary Against the Evil Eye  
In Southern Europe, rosemary was a frontline defense against the evil eye.

Families planted it:

- by the front step  
- by the gate  
- along the path a guest walked  
- beside windows  
- under the eaves  

So that **any ill intention, envy, or malocchio** was broken before entering the house.

Sometimes sprigs were tucked into door wreaths during major festivals—especially the **[Twelve Nights](/twelve-nights-witchcraft/)** and midsummer.

## The Witch’s Test: Who Passes the Rosemary?  
In several regions (particularly Italy and Dalmatia), folklore says:

**A person who dislikes the smell of rosemary cannot be trusted.**

Not because of morality, but because “something rides behind them.”

The threshold rosemary acted as:

- a test of character  
- a detector of hidden spirits  
- a ward against charmers or curse-workers  

If a visitor winced at the scent, old women would watch them closely until they left.

## Rosemary for House Blessings  
Rosemary planted by the door was also part of housewarming rituals.

A cutting was placed:

- on the doorstep  
- under the threshold stone  
- tied to the lintel  
- buried at the gate post  

These actions were meant to declare:

**“This house stands clean, protected, and awake.”**
