## Rituals and Beliefs

### Night Fires and Ceremonies

One of the most captivating aspects of Vlach Magic is the use of night fires. During these ceremonies, practitioners gather around bonfires, chanting in the Vlach language. The fires are believed to purify the soul and ward off evil spirits. Participants often visit streams or watermills, performing dances and songs to invoke blessings and protection.

### The Power of Water

Water holds a sacred place in Vlach Magic. Streams, rivers, and wells are considered portals to the spiritual world. By looking into the water, practitioners may seek guidance from ancestors or receive visions. Some rituals involve immersing oneself to cleanse the spirit or gain insight.

### Celestial Worship

The Vlachs revere celestial bodies as powerful entities that influence life on Earth. Rituals are often timed to lunar phases or celestial events, amplifying the potency of the magic performed. The sun, moon, and stars are central to many seasonal ceremonies and protective practices.

## Women as Keepers of Magic

In Vlach communities, women are the primary practitioners of magic. Often referred to as witches or shamans, they possess deep knowledge of herbs, spells, and rituals. These women are sought after for their healing abilities and spiritual guidance, preserving the community’s mystical heritage across generations.
