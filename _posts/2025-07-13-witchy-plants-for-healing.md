## ✦ The Witch as Healer

Long before white coats and pills, the healer was a barefoot woman with dirt under her nails and herbs drying from the rafters. She listened to the land and whispered to the plants. She was the village midwife, the wound-binder, the one who knew what root to dig when fevers ran high or hearts ran hollow.

To be a witch is often to be a healer—and healing is not just physical. It's spiritual, ancestral, emotional. The herbs below were once carried in pouches, stirred into teas, burned in rites, or tucked beneath beds to mend what modern medicine can't always touch.

Here are some of the most beloved witchy herbs for healing—deeply rooted in folklore, magic, and earth wisdom.

## ✦ Healing Is a Spell

To heal is to cast a spell—whether with poultices and prayers, tinctures and touch, or simply the presence of love and intention.

True witchcraft doesn’t separate the physical from the magical. A healing herb is both a medicine and a message, a remedy and a ritual.

Let your apothecary be your altar.
