## Modern Hormone Advice Has One Goal: Control

Flatten symptoms.  
Normalize charts.  
Stabilize numbers.

This is not inherently harmful — but it is **philosophically opposite** to how women were treated for thousands of years.

Folk medicine did not seek hormonal sameness.  
It expected fluctuation.  
It anticipated **cycles, thresholds, and transitions** as essential parts of a woman’s life.

## Folk Medicine Treated Change as Inevitable

Across cultures:
- puberty was disruptive  
- fertility was exhausting  
- perimenopause was dangerous  
- elderhood was powerful  

None of these experiences were meant to feel “normal.”  
They were meant to be **navigated with care, ritual, and herbal support**.

Modern hormone advice, by contrast, often **suppresses signals**:
- stopping bleeding early  
- suppressing ovulation long-term  
- flattening emotional variation  
- overriding heat, sweat, insomnia  

Folk medicine saw these as **messages**, not malfunctions. They informed timing, treatment, and spiritual protection.

## Balance vs Timing: The Philosophical Divide

Modern systems aim for balance.  
Folk systems prioritized **right action at the right time**.

A herb used too early could harm; too late, it might be useless.  
Even diet and daily practices were adjusted to life stage, season, and circumstance.

This is evident in classical Chinese medicine, where menstrual irregularity was **never treated as a pathology**. Physicians considered **seasonal qi, age, and life context**, prescribing herbs to align internal rhythms rather than flatten them. Time was always a partner, not an enemy.

## Example: Bitters & Blood

Modern advice often promotes bitters continuously.  

Folk medicine restricted bitters:
- avoided during heavy bleeding years  
- introduced at threshold years  
- emphasized post-menopause  

**Timing mattered more than dosage**. Herbs were part of a larger system: spiritual, social, and physiological.

## Folklore in Action: Global Examples

To understand how folk medicine perceived female change, we can look at **documented, cross-cultural examples**:

- **European Witch Lore (Hutton, *The Witch*)**  

  Women with unusual bleeding patterns were sometimes **feared for their liminal power**.

  Midwives were consulted not to normalize cycles but to **guide women through dangerous thresholds**.

  Scottish midwives kept **rue and yarrow** to ward off spirits that might drain strength during menstruation or perimenopause.

- **Balkan Fairies and Threshold Women (Pócs, *Fairies and Witches at the Boundary of South-Eastern Europe*)**  

  Women carried **mugwort or juniper pouches** to protect against intrusive fairies that could disrupt fertility or vitality.

  These practices were functional, encoded into daily life, and **intertwined herbal care with spiritual vigilance**.

- **Chinese Medicine (Unschuld, *Medicine in China*)**
  
  Irregular cycles were **read as messages**, not disorders.

  Herbs were prescribed contextually, respecting natural fluctuations, and interventions shifted across seasons, life stages, and personal constitution.

- **Japanese Menopause Myths (Lock, *Encounters with Aging*)**  

  Edo-period women entering menopause were sometimes **feared for disruptive spiritual energy**, while others were welcomed as **keepers of ancestral wisdom**.

  Physiological changes coincided with socially valuable liminal roles.

- **American Midwifery (Davis-Floyd, *Birth as an American Rite of Passage*)**  

  Perimenstrual and perimenopausal women were given ceremonial roles — **dreaming, divining, teaching young women** — and access to tonics for **endurance, blood, and nervous strength**.

  Transition phases were **socially functional, not clinical failures**.

- **Ayurveda (Wujastyk, *The Roots of Ayurveda*)**  

  Herbs and diet were aligned with reproductive cycles and hormonal shifts.

  Shatavari (*Asparagus racemosus*) supported vitality and spiritual readiness during perimenopause, **without suppressing natural changes**.

- **Midwives and Nurses in Early Modern Europe (Ehrenreich & English, *Witches, Midwives, and Nurses*)**  

  Herbal skill often surpassed hormonal management.

  Midwives recognized that fatigue, hot flashes, or irregular cycles were **natural signals**, and their interventions emphasized **prevention, support, and ritual protection**, not artificial normalization.

---

These examples reveal a **central principle** across continents and eras: traditional medicine treated women as **processes unfolding over time**, not systems to be artificially stabilized. 

Hot flashes, irregular bleeding, and mood changes were **messages to navigate**, not failures to correct.

---

## Why Women Feel Worse Now

Modern systems often:
- stabilize when the body should be transitioning  
- stimulate when energy should be conserved  
- silence when protection is needed  

Folk medicine **expected and respected instability**, planning around it with herbs, rituals, and community practices.

---

## This Is Not Nostalgia

Traditional systems had limits.  
They lacked modern emergency medicine.  

Yet they had a **precise understanding of female time**.  
Modern advice is powerful — but often blind to rhythm.

---

## What Integration Looks Like

- Not rejection.  
- Not romanticization.  

It’s remembering that **numbers are not the body — time is**.  

Herbs, rituals, and social structures were designed to **support transitions, not flatten them**.
