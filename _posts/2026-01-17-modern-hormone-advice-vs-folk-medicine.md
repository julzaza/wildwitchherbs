## Modern Hormone Advice Has One Goal: Control

Flatten symptoms.  
Normalize charts.  
Stabilize numbers.

This is not inherently harmful — but it is **philosophically opposite** to how women were treated for thousands of years.

Folk medicine did not seek hormonal sameness.

It expected fluctuation.

## Folk Medicine Treated Change as Inevitable

Across cultures:
- puberty was disruptive
- fertility was exhausting
- perimenopause was dangerous
- elderhood was powerful

None of these were meant to feel “normal.”

They were meant to be **navigated**.

---

## Modern Advice Suppresses Transitional Signals

Common contradictions:
- stopping bleeding early
- suppressing ovulation long-term
- flattening emotional variation
- overriding heat, sweat, insomnia

Folk medicine saw these as **messages**, not malfunctions.

---

## The Core Disagreement: Balance vs Timing

Modern systems aim for balance.

Folk systems prioritized **right action at the right time**.

A herb used too early was poison.  
A herb used too late was useless.

This logic appears clearly in classical Chinese medicine, where menstrual irregularity was not treated as a condition to be stabilized, but as a phase requiring different interventions depending on *season, age, and life context*. 

Treatment shifted across time rather than enforcing consistency.

---

## Example: Bitters & Blood

Modern advice often promotes bitters continuously.

Folk medicine restricted bitters:
- avoided during heavy bleeding years
- introduced during threshold years
- emphasized post-menopause

Timing mattered more than dosage.

## Folklore in Action: Stories from Across Cultures

To understand how folk medicine perceived female change, we can draw on documented traditions and narratives:

- **European Witch Lore (Hutton, *The Witch*)**  
  In 16th–17th century Europe, women who had unusual bleeding patterns or hormonal changes were sometimes **feared for their liminal power**. Hutton records accounts from Germany and Scotland where midwives and herbalists were sought not to “normalize” cycles but to **guide women through dangerous thresholds**, using herbs and ritual protection. One Scottish midwife was reputed to keep a small cache of rue and yarrow not to adjust fertility, but to **ward off malevolent spirits that might disrupt the household** during a woman’s menstruation or perimenopause.

- **Balkan Fairies and Threshold Women (Pócs, *Fairies and Witches at the Boundary of South-Eastern Europe*)**  
  Pócs documents stories of Balkan women who carried **small pouches of mugwort or juniper** to protect against intrusive fairies during periods of hormonal change. These spirits were believed to drain strength or fertility. The protective practice was **not superstition**, but a carefully coded system of spiritual and physiological safeguarding, integrated into daily life.

- **Chinese Medicine (Unschuld, *Medicine in China*)**  
  In classical Chinese medicine, menstrual irregularity was **never treated as a pathology**. Instead, Unschuld notes that physicians categorized women’s cycles according to seasonal qi and personal constitution. A woman’s unusual heat, restlessness, or fluid imbalance was interpreted as **an opportunity to realign internal rhythms**, not to flatten them artificially. Herbs were prescribed contextually, respecting natural fluctuations over time.

- **Japanese Menopause Myths (Lock, *Encounters with Aging*)**  
  Lock describes how in Edo-period Japan, older women entering menopause were sometimes **feared for their disruptive spiritual energy**. Certain shrines had rituals to “contain” their influence, while other households welcomed them as **keepers of ancestral wisdom**, recognizing that their physiological transitions also coincided with a socially valuable liminal status.

- **American Midwifery (Davis-Floyd, *Birth as an American Rite of Passage*)**  
  Among some Indigenous North American communities, perimenstrual and perimenopausal women were entrusted with ceremonial roles — **dreaming, divining, and teaching young women**, while simultaneously being given access to herbal tonics tailored for endurance, blood nourishment, and nervous strength. These practices highlight that **transition phases were socially functional, not clinical failures**.

- **Ayurveda (Wujastyk, *The Roots of Ayurveda*)**  
  Ayurvedic texts describe women’s life stages (*Ashraya*), where herbs and diet were **aligned with reproductive cycles and hormonal shifts**. Wujastyk notes the use of Shatavari (Asparagus racemosus) and other uterine tonics during perimenopause, **not to suppress symptoms**, but to sustain vitality and spiritual readiness.

- **Midwives and Nurses in Early Modern Europe (Ehrenreich & English, *Witches, Midwives, and Nurses*)**  
  These authors document that women’s work in birth and household care often relied on **herbal skill over hormonal manipulation**. Midwives understood that fatigue, hot flashes, or irregular cycles were **natural signals**, and their interventions emphasized **prevention, support, and ritual protection** rather than normalization.

---

These examples illustrate a **central principle** across continents and eras: traditional medicine treated women as **processes unfolding over time**, not systems to be artificially stabilized. Hot flashes, irregular bleeding, and mood changes were **messages**, not failures — and the treatments reflected this nuanced understanding.


## Why Women Feel Worse Now

Because they are:
- stabilized when they should be transitioning
- stimulated when they should be conserving
- silenced when they should be protected

Folk medicine expected instability — and planned for it.

Folk systems assumed discomfort was temporary; modern systems often assume it is pathological.

---

## This Is Not Nostalgia

Traditional systems had limits.
They lacked emergency medicine.

But their **understanding of female time** was precise.

Modern advice is powerful — but often blind to rhythm.

---

## What Integration Looks Like

Not rejection.
Not romanticization.

But remembering that **numbers are not the body**.

Time is.
