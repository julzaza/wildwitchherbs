## Modern Hormone Advice Has One Goal: Control

Flatten symptoms.  
Normalize charts.  
Stabilize numbers.

This is not inherently harmful — but it is **philosophically opposite** to how women were treated for thousands of years.

Folk medicine did not seek hormonal sameness.

It expected fluctuation.

## Folk Medicine Treated Change as Inevitable

Across cultures:
- puberty was disruptive
- fertility was exhausting
- perimenopause was dangerous
- elderhood was powerful

None of these were meant to feel “normal.”

They were meant to be **navigated**.

---

## Modern Advice Suppresses Transitional Signals

Common contradictions:
- stopping bleeding early
- suppressing ovulation long-term
- flattening emotional variation
- overriding heat, sweat, insomnia

Folk medicine saw these as **messages**, not malfunctions.

---

## The Core Disagreement: Balance vs Timing

Modern systems aim for balance.

Folk systems prioritized **right action at the right time**.

A herb used too early was poison.  
A herb used too late was useless.

This logic appears clearly in classical Chinese medicine, where menstrual irregularity was not treated as a condition to be stabilized, but as a phase requiring different interventions depending on *season, age, and life context*. Treatment shifted across time rather than enforcing consistency.

## Example: Bitters & Blood

Modern advice often promotes bitters continuously.

Folk medicine restricted bitters:
- avoided during heavy bleeding years
- introduced during threshold years
- emphasized post-menopause

Timing mattered more than dosage.

## Why Women Feel Worse Now

Because they are:
- stabilized when they should be transitioning
- stimulated when they should be conserving
- silenced when they should be protected

Folk medicine expected instability — and planned for it.

Folk systems assumed discomfort was temporary; modern systems often assume it is pathological.

---

## This Is Not Nostalgia

Traditional systems had limits.
They lacked emergency medicine.

But their **understanding of female time** was precise.

Modern advice is powerful — but often blind to rhythm.

---

## What Integration Looks Like

Not rejection.
Not romanticization.

But remembering that **numbers are not the body**.

Time is.
