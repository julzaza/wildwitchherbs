Every **June 24th**, on the feast of **St. John the Baptist**, villages along the Timok and Mlava rivers come alive with a ritual that **predates Christianity**.  

Known locally as *pali hod* (“burning walk”), this Vlach tradition is part **Christian celebration**, part **sun-worshipping festival**.

## Ancient Roots Beneath the Ashes
Archaeologists trace similar fire rites back to **Thracian and Dacian cults** of the sun.  

In Vlaska Magija lore, the flames awaken the **spirit of the grain**, ensuring a fertile harvest and warding off sickness. 

The church later overlaid the ritual with the name of St. John, but villagers still whisper that the fire belongs to the **old gods of summer**.

## The Night of the Flames
At dusk, men and women gather around a **giant bonfire of oak**, the tree sacred to Perun, the Slavic thunder god. 

When the logs collapse into embers, the bravest **walk barefoot across the glowing coals**, singing invocations in a mix of **archaic Romanian dialect** and Serbian.  

Before stepping onto the fire, each participant receives a **protective charm**: a sprig of **wormwood** tied with red thread. Old women say the wormwood “drinks the heat,” keeping the skin unburned.

## Magic and Medicine
Local healers collect ashes from the fire the next morning. 

Mixed with spring water, these ashes are **dabbed on the forehead to break fevers** or added to animal feed to **protect livestock from disease**—a practice recorded by 19th-century ethnographers and still alive today.

The concept of collecting **holy water for healing and protection** from the spring, is a practice highlighted in the **[Seven Sacred Springs of Serbia](/seven-sacred-springs-serbia/)**, where each spring carries its own magical history.

## Science Meets Tradition
Modern research shows that experienced firewalkers maintain calm breathing and steady pace, reducing contact time and avoiding burns. 

The wormwood’s volatile oils may also have a mild **cooling, antimicrobial effect**, lending scientific weight to the “protective” herb.
