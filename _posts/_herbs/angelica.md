## Overview
Angelica is known as the “Root of the Holy Ghost,” a towering sentinel in the herbal world. Its name was whispered to monks by an angel, and for centuries it was revered as a divine protector. In the witch’s grimoire, Angelica is a guardian—bold, fragrant, and sacred. It invites ancestral spirits while banishing malicious ones, wrapping the witch in the breath of celestial fire.

## Magical Uses
- Protection from spiritual attack or baneful magic
- Necromantic rituals and ancestral communion
- Exorcism rites and house purification
- Courage, harmony, and solar energy in spells

## Folklore and Myth
Legend holds that Angelica blooms on May 8th, the feast of St. Michael the Archangel. During plagues, villagers carried Angelica root as a charm against death. In Norse myth, some associate it with Freya’s maternal energy. Hoodoo traditions use it in graveyard work and spiritual protection blends. Its divine name marks it as a link between worlds.

## Regions and Growing Conditions
Native to the cold, damp meadows of Northern Europe and Siberia. Angelica thrives in rich soil, partial shade, and moist ground. It grows tall and hollow-stemmed, with fragrant leaves that resemble both celery and magic.

## Toxicity and Warnings
Angelica is generally safe in small amounts but can cause photosensitivity when handled fresh or taken in large doses. Avoid during pregnancy unless under guidance.

## Spell or Ritual Example
Burn dried Angelica root with frankincense on your ancestral altar. Speak aloud the names of your ancestors, asking for protection and wisdom. The smoke acts as a bridge between your body and their memory, sealing your circle with divine fire.
