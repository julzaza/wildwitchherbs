## Overview
Angelica carries the voice of the archangel who whispered its name to medieval monks. Tall and hollow-stemmed, it was believed to bloom on the feast of Michael the Archangel. In witchcraft, Angelica is a protector herbâ€”bold, divine, and fiercely ancestral. It is often called the "Herb of the Holy Ghost."

## Magical Uses
- Protection against evil spirits and curses
- Ancestral magic and necromancy
- Exorcism rituals
- Harmony, courage, and inner strength

## Folklore and Myth
In European folklore, Angelica was said to cure the plague and was carried during processions to protect entire villages. Its name was revealed in a dream by an angel to a healer during an outbreak. Norse tradition sometimes links it to Freya, and in hoodoo, it's used in graveyard rituals.
