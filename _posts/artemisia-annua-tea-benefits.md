description: Discover the ancient uses and natural potency of Artemisia annua tea — a wild, bitter herb with deep roots in traditional wellness and folk wisdom.

In the old herbal ways, bitter didn’t mean bad — it meant powerful.

*Artemisia annua*, sometimes called sweet wormwood or qinghao, has long been prized for its sharp taste and sharper intelligence. This isn’t your gentle garden herb. It’s a sun-thirsty, silver-leaved survivor — a plant that thrives where others wilt, brimming with volatile oils and ancient strength.

It’s no coincidence that generations across Asia, Africa, and the Balkans have turned to it in times of hardship. This is a plant of resilience. And its tea? Bold, earthy, unmistakable — with a taste that says *you’ve just sipped something real*.

## Why Drink Artemisia Tea?

Drinking *Artemisia annua* is not about soft comfort. It’s a practice, a ritual, a return to something wilder. The bitterness acts like a reset — awakening the senses, stirring the blood, demanding your attention. In folk traditions, such bitter herbs were valued for their ability to “clear heat,” balance the system, and fortify the body’s natural rhythm with the seasons.

In the Balkans, where we harvest our tea, women once gathered Artemisia with the moon, drying it slowly in shaded kitchens, away from harsh sunlight. The result is a clean, piercing infusion that feels alive — one cup is enough to remind you: this is no supermarket herb.

## What Makes Ours Different

Not all Artemisia is equal. Much of what you’ll find on the market is industrial-grown, dried too fast, or diluted with other herbs. Our tea comes from wildcrafted, sun-fed plants — hand-harvested in the south Balkans and slow-dried in mountain air. Nothing added. Nothing altered. Just the pure herb in her strongest form.

The tea is pungent, grassy, and slightly metallic, with a lingering finish that stays with you — not unlike the clarity it offers.

## A Ritual of the Old Ways

To brew it, take a pinch — about a teaspoon — and steep in hot water (never boiling) for 5 to 10 minutes with a covered lid. Inhale the aroma. Taste the edge. If you’re used to herbal teas that are more floral or sweet, prepare to be surprised. This is an herb with an opinion.

Some drink it as a seasonal tonic. Others use it in dreamwork, cleansing rituals, or to simply remember what wild medicine feels like.

## Drink it With Intention

We won’t make bold medical claims. We’ll just say this: there’s a reason *Artemisia annua* has endured for centuries. A reason herbalists, witches, monks, and midwives carried it across continents and down bloodlines. It’s not an herb you forget once you’ve met it.

And if you’re ready to meet it — we keep a small batch of our tea [available here in the shop](/shop/), while the harvest lasts.
