  # **The Nine Herbs Charm: Ancient Anglo-Saxon Healing Magic**

  The **Nine Herbs Charm**, also known as **Nigon Wyrta Galdor**, the **Lay of the Nine Healing Herbs**, or the **Nine Wort Spell**, is one of the most remarkable examples of **Old English magic**. Recorded in the **tenth century AD**, it survives in the **Lacnunga**, a collection of **Anglo-Saxon medical texts** preserved in the **British Library’s Harley MS 585 manuscript**.  

  This spell blends **herbal knowledge**, **mythology**, and **ritual power**, involving the preparation and use of **nine sacred herbs** for **healing and protection**.

  ## **Woden and the Power of Nine**

  One of the most fascinating aspects of the charm is its reference to **Woden**, making it one of only **two clear mentions of this god in Old English poetry** (the other is in *Maxims I* of the Exeter Book).  

  Robert K. Gordon’s translation reads:

  > “A snake came crawling, it bit a man.  
  > Then Woden took **nine glory-twigs**,  
  > Smote the serpent so that it flew into nine parts.  
  > There apple brought this pass against poison,  
  > That she nevermore would enter her house.”

  Here, **Woden intervenes with nine twigs**, striking down the venomous serpent. Scholars suggest these twigs may have been inscribed with **runes representing the first letters of each herb**, linking **divine power directly to the plants**.

  The charm repeatedly emphasizes the numbers **three** and **nine**, sacred in **Germanic paganism**, underscoring the **magical potency of the ritual** and the alignment of **herbs, numbers, and divine energy**.

  ## **The Nine Healing Herbs**

  The exact list varies, but the nine herbs are generally considered to include:

  - **Mugwort**  
  - **Plantain**  
  - **Lamb's Cress**  
  - **Betony**  
  - **Chamomile**  
  - **Crab-Apple**  
  - **Nettle**  
  - **Fennel**  
  - **Garlic**

  Each herb carries **symbolic, medicinal, and magical significance**, reflecting a worldview where **nature and spirit are inseparable**.  

  Chanting the poem aloud was essential. Malcolm Laurence Cameron notes it produces a **“marvellously incantatory effect,”** transforming a herbal preparation into a **powerful ritual of healing and protection**.

  ## **Pagan Roots & Christian Censorship**

  The charm’s **language and imagery** point to **pre-Christian origins**. Gordon observes that it was likely **Christianized** to conform with spiritual norms of the time.  

  Despite this, the poem retains its **raw, mystical energy**, revealing the enduring human desire to connect with **plants, ritual, and divine power**.

  ## **Modern Application of the Nine Herbs Charm**

  Today, the charm can inspire **modern herbalists and witches**:

  - **Herbs as Sacred Allies:** See plants as carriers of **healing energy and protection**.  
  - **Numbers as Magic:** The repeated use of **three and nine** symbolizes **completeness, cycles, and magical potency**.  
  - **Spoken Word Transforms:** Chanting, reading aloud, or setting **intention** amplifies the power of herbal or protective rituals.

  At **Wild Witch Herbs**, we honor these **ancient practices**, encouraging a **story-rich connection** with herbs and the magical lore they carry. The **Nine Herbs Charm** reminds us that **plants, words, and belief** have always worked together to heal, protect, and empower.
