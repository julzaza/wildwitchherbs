## Historical Context: Why Some Herbs Were Approached with Caution by Women

Globally, **women’s herbal caution combined practical, spiritual, and symbolic concerns**. Herbs affecting menstruation, fertility, or spiritual thresholds were never simply “banned” — they were **respected, monitored, and ritualized**.  

The underlying principles included:

- **Reproductive caution:** Plants that could stimulate menstruation, affect conception, or act as abortifacients.  
- **Spiritual protection:** Herbs used in liminal rituals, dreams, or vision work required care to avoid spiritual harm.  
- **Symbolic gender associations:** Certain seeds, roots, or flowers were connected with fertility, life, or liminality, shaping culturally prescribed use.  

Across continents, **oral traditions, midwifery manuals, and herbal texts** reinforced these guidelines.
