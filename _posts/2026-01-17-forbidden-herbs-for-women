## Historical Context: Why Some Herbs Were Forbidden for Women

Across time and cultures, certain herbs were **explicitly forbidden to women** because they could:

- Induce miscarriage or menstruation  
- Cause physical harm due to toxicity  
- Interfere with ritual or spiritual processes  
- Violate gendered ceremonial norms  

These prohibitions were often codified in **folk practice, midwifery manuals, and ritual instruction**, not imagined later.

## Notable Forbidden Herbs for Women

### 1. Tansy (*Tanacetum vulgare*)  
**Reason Forbidden:** Abortifacient, menstrual stimulant.  
**Evidence & Folklore:** 16–18th century European herbal texts and midwifery manuals instructed women **never to use tansy casually during pregnancy**, though midwives might employ it under careful supervision.  

### 2. Pennyroyal (*Mentha pulegium*)  
**Reason Forbidden:** Strong emmenagogue and abortifacient.  
**Evidence & Folklore:** Widely cited in European herbal traditions; casual ingestion by women was prohibited. Often used only in controlled midwifery rituals.  

### 3. Belladonna / Deadly Nightshade (*Atropa belladonna*)  
**Reason Forbidden:** Toxicity, liminal spiritual association.  
**Evidence & Folklore:** Bukovinian and Central European traditions documented **roots forbidden to menstruating women**, associated with flying ointments, visions, and danger to inexperienced users.  

### 4. Mandrake (*Mandragora officinarum*)  
**Reason Forbidden:** Ritual danger; deadly scream.  
**Evidence & Folklore:** Southern European folklore explicitly forbade women from harvesting mandrake; male ritual specialists were required. The root’s “scream” was believed fatal if heard by a woman.  

### 5. Wolfsbane (*Aconitum napellus*)  
**Reason Forbidden:** Poison preparation and spiritual vulnerability.  
**Evidence & Folklore:** Some European midwifery texts and folk accounts restricted women from handling wolfsbane, linking misuse to reproductive or spiritual danger.

## Cross-Cultural Patterns

| Herb | Forbidden To | Reason / Folklore | Region / Tradition |
|------|--------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Tansy | Women | Abortifacient, menstrual stimulant | Europe |
| Pennyroyal | Women | Induce menstruation/abortifacient, ritual control | Europe |
| Belladonna | Women | Toxicity, liminal rituals | Bukovina, Central Europe |
| Mandrake | Women | Deadly scream, ritual harvest | Southern Europe |
| Wolfsbane | Women | Poison prep, spiritual vulnerability | Europe |

Across **Asia and the Americas**, some fertility herbs and psychoactive plants were similarly restricted for women depending on ceremonial role, reproductive stage, or liminal status.

---

## Folklore Stories

- **Mandrake:** In Italy and Spain, folklore warns women that digging mandrake alone could be fatal. Men used dogs to dig and invoke rituals to protect against the scream.  
- **Belladonna:** In Bukovina, roots were used in threshold rituals to connect with the Otherworld. Women menstruating were forbidden to handle the root due to both toxicity and spiritual danger.  
- **Pennyroyal & Tansy:** Midwives used precise doses for fertility control or menstruation regulation, but unsupervised female use was explicitly forbidden in multiple European texts.  

---

## Practical Insights

- “Forbidden” herbs often intersect **reproductive caution, ritual significance, and spiritual protection**.  
- Usage restrictions were **age- and context-specific**, not universal bans.  
- Folklore codified these rules, transmitted orally or via midwifery manuals.

## Historical Context: Why Some Herbs Were Approached with Caution by Women

Globally, **women’s herbal caution combined practical, spiritual, and symbolic concerns**. Herbs affecting menstruation, fertility, or spiritual thresholds were never simply “banned” — they were **respected, monitored, and ritualized**.  

The underlying principles included:

- **Spiritual protection:** Herbs used in liminal rituals, dreams, or vision work required care to avoid spiritual harm.
