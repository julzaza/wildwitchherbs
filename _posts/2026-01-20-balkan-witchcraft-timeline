## Balkan Witchcraft: A Timeline (Without the Fairy Tales)

Balkan witchcraft didn’t erupt suddenly.  
It **slowly hardened out of everyday folk life**.

Here’s what actually happened.

---

## Before the 1500s — Magic as Survival

Folk magic was part of daily life:
- herbal healing
- charms against illness
- fertility rites
- protection from the evil eye

These practices were **not criminal**.  
They were necessary.

There was no clear category called “witch.”

## 1500s–1600s — Western Influence Arrives

Church and legal authorities began importing:
- demonological language
- heresy frameworks
- interrogation methods

But in the Balkans, accusations still focused on:
- sickness
- misfortune
- poisoning  
—not Satan.

## 1700s — Peak Witch Trials (Especially Croatia)

Between **1740–1752**, northern Croatia saw intensified prosecutions:
- Zagreb
- Varaždin
- Križevci counties

Cases focused on **harm caused**, not cosmic evil.

The most famous accused:
→ **Magda Logomer**, tortured and tried as a witch before imperial intervention halted the trial.

---

## Late 1700s–1800s — Decline, Not Disappearance

Formal witch trials declined.  
Folk belief did not.

Accusations shifted into:
- gossip
- poison scares
- informal justice
- medical suspicion

---

## 1900s — The Witch Rebranded as Poisoner

In rural Yugoslavia, fear resurfaced through **criminal courts**, not inquisitions.

The most infamous case:
→ **Baba Anujka**, tried in the 1920s for poisoning using folk knowledge.

Magic was no longer supernatural.  
It was *dangerously practical*.

## Why This Timeline Matters

It was **reframed**.
