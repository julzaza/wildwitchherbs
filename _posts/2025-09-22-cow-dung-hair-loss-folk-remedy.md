High on the Durmitor plateau, where pine forests meet high meadows, stories of mountain cures still move from hearth to hearth.  
One of the strangest—and most memorable—tells that when a person’s hair begins to thin, the surest remedy is **fresh cow dung spread across the scalp**.  

## A Folk Remedy of Survival  
Before pharmacies and bottled tonics, villagers in the Žabljak region worked with whatever life gave them.  
Cows were wealth: they provided milk, meat, leather, and the manure that kept vegetable gardens thriving.  
That rich, steaming manure symbolized **fertility and renewal**. If it could transform poor soil into a lush meadow, why not coax new hair from a tired scalp?  
Older Montenegrins describe mixing a small lump of fresh dung with mountain spring water, patting it onto bald patches, and covering the head with a wool cloth while reciting protective words.

## Magical Protection and the Evil Eye  
Hair loss was rarely seen as simple biology.  
In traditional Balkan belief, sudden shedding could mean the “evil eye” had struck or that cold mountain winds had stolen the body’s heat.  
Cow dung, warm and pungent, carried the cow’s own vitality.  
Applying it was an act of **sympathetic magic**—borrowing the animal’s strength while its strong odor drove away the malevolent force.

## Regional Echoes and Kindred Practices  
This custom belongs to a wider tapestry of Dinaric folk medicine:

* **Sheep or goat droppings in Bosnia and Herzegovina** were mixed with lard to make poultices for swollen joints.  
* **Smoke baths (kadjenje)** combined dried dung, juniper, and wild herbs to cleanse homes and people of illness or curse.  
* **River clay and wood ash scalp washes** were common in Montenegro’s mountain villages for both cleansing and spiritual protection.  
* Across old Slavic lands, burning dried manure as incense was thought to scare away spirits that caused disease.

Even farther afield, similar beliefs appear: Ayurvedic India honors cow dung for purification, and ancient Roman and Egyptian texts list animal manure in skin and hair recipes.

## From Folklore to Modern Science  
However, fresh dung can harbor bacteria such as *E. coli*, tetanus spores, and parasites that pose real health risks.  

## Safer Herbal Parallels  
If you love the earthy spirit but don't want to risk contact with pathogens, turn to plants long gathered in these same highlands:  
* **Nettle rinses** rich in minerals to strengthen the scalp.  
* **Rosemary infusions** to boost circulation and fragrance the hair.  
* **Yarrow washes** for gentle cleansing and a touch of protective magic.

These herbs carry the scent of tradition without the hazards of fresh manure.
