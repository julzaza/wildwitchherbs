## A Gift of the Silent Tongue

Among the mist-soaked peaks and forested valleys of the Balkans, there is a tale whispered around hearthfires: **Nemušti Jezik**, literally *the Speechless Tongue* or *Silent Language*.  
It is more than a children’s story.  
It is a key to a world where every living creature has a voice and every stone, stream, and branch carries a hidden truth.

First written down in the nineteenth century by the great folklorist **Vuk Stefanović Karadžić**, the story reaches back far beyond the age of books, to a time when shepherds, snakes, and spirits conversed beneath the moon.

## The Shepherd and the Snake

A humble shepherd once heard frantic cries rising from the forest.  
Following the sound, he found a great snake encircled by fire.  
Instead of fear, compassion moved him.  
He risked his life to save the creature, carrying it to safety.

The snake—no ordinary beast but a guardian of old—rewarded the shepherd with a single draught of enchanted milk.  
The moment it touched his tongue, **the world changed**.  
Birdsong became words.  
Ants discussed their hidden kingdoms.  
Rivers whispered of ancient journeys.  
The shepherd had been given the **Nemušti Jezik**, the ability to understand and speak the language of every living being.

But this gift came with a silent warning:  
*Never reveal the source of your knowledge, or the gift will destroy you.*

## Power and Peril

The shepherd prospered.  
He knew when storms would strike because the crows told him.  
He found lost sheep because the wind carried their bleats to his ears.  
Yet his wife grew suspicious.  
“How do you know everything?” she demanded.

Bound by his oath, he would not tell.  
But the pressure mounted until he resolved to confess—  
and only at the final moment did he realize that to speak would cost him his life.  
He kept his silence, proving that some knowledge must remain secret.

This ending reminds us that **true magic is responsibility**.  
Understanding the thoughts of beasts and spirits is no gift for idle gossip; it is a covenant with the unseen.

## Echoes of Older Beliefs

The Nemušti Jezik is not just a Serbian curiosity.  
Legends of animal speech at sacred times—especially **Christmas Eve, St. John’s Eve, and midwinter nights**—appear across Europe.  
But in the Balkans, they take on a special flavor, where **pre-Christian animism** mingles with Orthodox rites and the deep mountain mysticism of the **Vlach people**.

### Connection to Vlach Magija

The **Vlach** (Wallachian) communities of eastern Serbia, Romania, and Montenegro are renowned for their **magija**—old magic that blends Roman, Thracian, and Slavic elements.  
Vlach witches, or *babe*, still speak of nights when animals reveal secrets and herbs answer questions.  
In their rites, **understanding the voices of nature is central**:  
- Owls and crows serve as messengers.  
- Snakes guard thresholds and ancestral wisdom.  
- Plants are approached with words of power, as if they, too, have language.

The shepherd’s pact with the serpent mirrors these practices.  
The snake is a **totemic guide**, bridging earth and underworld, much like the serpent-spirits honored in Vlach healing ceremonies.  
For a modern herbalist or witch, this story resonates as a reminder that **plants and animals speak if we know how to listen**.

## Lessons for the Modern Witch

Whether you gather **Artemisia annua** beneath a waxing moon or walk the quiet forest at dusk, the Nemušti Jezik invites you to:

* **Listen before you speak.** Magic begins with observation.  
* **Honor the pact.** Knowledge from the natural world is a gift, not a commodity.  
* **Respect the serpent.** In Balkan lore, snakes are protectors of the hearth and carriers of ancient memory.

For the Wild Witchy herbalist, this tale is a call to deepen your relationship with the living earth.  
Every herb has a voice, every breeze a message.  
The question is not whether they speak—but whether you will keep the silence required to hear them.
