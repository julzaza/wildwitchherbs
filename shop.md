## 🌿 Artemisia annua Seeds — €5  
*Ancestral strain · Hand-harvested · Balkan lineage*

These are not ordinary seeds.  
They are descendants of wild, sun-drenched plants grown in the mineral-rich soils of southern Albania — where Artemisia thrives like nowhere else.

Collected by hand, aligned with the moon, and dried under the same sun that forged their bitter strength, these seeds carry an ancient resilience. They have not been bred for mass production. They have not been tamed.

They are for those who understand that to grow a plant is to enter into a pact.

**Contents**: Enough to start a sacred patch or fill several deep pots.  
Sow in warmth. Water with intention. The plant will respond.

## 🍵 Artemisia annua Tea — €8  
*50g loose leaf · Wild-harvested · Sun-cured*

This tea is not gentle. It is not sweet.  
It is powerfully bitter, defiantly green, and utterly alive.

Hand-harvested under the right moon and slow-dried in Balkan heat, these leaves retain their full character — pungent, piercing, and clean. Nothing added. Nothing diluted. Just a wild herb at her strongest, prepared as she always has been.

Brew it when you need clarity.  
Drink it when you want to remember the old ways.

**Instructions**: Steep lightly. Sip with awareness.  
Not for daily indulgence — this is a tea to be met with respect.

## 🧪 Artemisia annua Tincture — €12  
*30ml · Fresh plant · 1:2 extract · 40% alcohol*

Distilled from living Artemisia — not dried, not dulled — this tincture captures the plant in her raw, unfiltered state. The leaves are harvested by hand at peak potency, following traditional Balkan rhythms: moon-timed, season-aligned, and never rushed.

Steeped in high-grade alcohol at a true 1:2 ratio, the extract is vivid green, sharp, and unapologetically bitter. This is not a soft herb. This is medicine as it once was — wild, volatile, precise.

No flavoring. No dilution. No false calm.

**Use sparingly. It does not take much.**
