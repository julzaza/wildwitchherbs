##  Artemisia Annua Seeds â€“ â‚¬5  

**[â†’ Order Artemisia Seeds by Email](mailto:info@wildwitchherbs.com?subject=Order%20Request%20-%20Artemisia%20Seeds&body=Hi%20Wild%20Witch%20Herbs%2C%0A%0AI'd%20like%20to%20order%20the%20Artemisia%20annua%20Seeds.%0A%0AMy%20name%3A%0AMy%20shipping%20address%3A%0APreferred%20payment%20method%20(PayPal%2C%20Revolut)%3A%0A%0AThank%20you.)**

These are not ordinary seeds.  
They are descendants of wild, sun-drenched plants grown in the mineral-rich soils of the southern Balkans â€” where Artemisia thrives like nowhere else.

They have not been bred for mass production. These seeds carry an ancient resilience. 
 
 ~0.02 grams per packet  
Enough for a small garden patch or several pots.

##  Artemisia Tincture â€“ â‚¬29  
*100ml Â· Fresh plant Â· 40% alcohol*

**[â†’ Order Artemisia Tincture by Email](mailto:info@wildwitchherbs.com?subject=Order%20Request%20-%20Artemisia%20Tincture&body=Hi%20Wild%20Witch%20Herbs%2C%0A%0AI'd%20like%20to%20order%20the%20Artemisia%20annua%20Tincture.%0A%0AMy%20name%3A%0AMy%20shipping%20address%3A%0APreferred%20payment%20method%20(PayPal%2C%20Revolut)%3A%0A%0AThank%20you.)**


Distilled from living Artemisia â€” not dried, not dulled â€” this tincture captures the plant in her raw, unfiltered state. Harvested by hand at peak potency, following traditional Balkan way.

Steeped in high-grade alcohol, the extract is sharp and unapologetically bitter. This is not a soft herb. This is medicine as it once was â€” wild, volatile, precise.

No flavoring. No dilution. 

**Use with caution. Not for pregnant or breastfeeding individuals.*
