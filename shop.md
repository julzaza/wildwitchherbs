##  Artemisia Annua Seeds â€“ â‚¬5  

These are not ordinary seeds.  
They are descendants of wild, sun-drenched plants grown in the mineral-rich soils of the Balkan south â€” where Artemisia thrives like nowhere else.

They have not been bred for mass production. These seeds carry an ancient resilience. 
 
About 0.02 grams per packet.
Enough for a small garden patch or several pots.

##  Artemisia Tincture â€“ â‚¬29  
*100ml Â· Fresh plant Â· 40% alcohol*

Distilled from living Artemisia â€” not dried, not dulled â€” this tincture captures the plant in her raw, unfiltered state. Harvested by hand at peak potency, following traditional Balkan way.

Steeped in high-grade alcohol, the extract is sharp and unapologetically bitter. This is not a soft herb. This is medicine as it once was â€” wild, volatile, precise.

No flavoring. No dilution. No false calm.
**Use with caution. Not for pregnant or breastfeeding individuals.**
