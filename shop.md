##  Artemisia Annua Seeds â€“ â‚¬5  
Homegrown, hand-harvested. Enough for a small garden patch or several pots. 0.02 grams per packet  
These are not ordinary seeds.  
They are descendants of wild, sun-drenched plants grown in the mineral-rich soils of the Balkan south â€” where Artemisia thrives like nowhere else.

These seeds carry an ancient resilience. They have not been bred for mass production. 
Â· Hand-harvested
